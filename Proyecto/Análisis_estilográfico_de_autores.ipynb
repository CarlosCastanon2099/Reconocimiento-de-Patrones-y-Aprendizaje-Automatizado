            "1582  :  The board of directors of WMX Technologies Inc. Wednesday rallied around its Chief Executive Phillip Rooney following a direct attack on his leadership by a major stockholder.\n",
            "An investment group led by financier George Soros called Tuesday for Rooney's ouster and proposed a slate of nominees for the board of the largest U.S. garbage-hauling company.\n",
            "In response, the WMX board said it \"unanimously reaffirmed its support for Phillip B. Rooney and his leadership of the company during his seven months as chief executive officer.\"\n",
            "The exchange did little but aggravate the acrimonious struggle involving WMX, Soros and other large shareholders.\n",
            "\"I don't think they could really escalate the animosity any higher than it already is,\" said James Kelleher, industry analyst at the Argus Research firm in New York.\n",
            "The New York-based Soros group and other investors, including the Lens Fund in Washington, D.C., have been pressuring WMX to improve its performance for months.\n",
            "WMX, based in Oak Brook, Ill., said last week that it was cutting 3,000 jobs and shedding $1.5 billion in assets in a broad effort to refocus on its core waste management business.\n",
            "On Tuesday, the Soros group expressed dissatisfaction with the restructuring plan, proposed removing Rooney and named four individuals to its alternate slate of board nominees.\n",
            "Even with a 5.2-percent stake in WMX, the Soros group cannot dictate the company's future, especially in the face of widespread small shareholder scepticism about the large shareholders' motives.\n",
            "\"They can make a lot of noise and smoke, but when everything is done, their effectiveness is limited ... This thing is far from over,\" Kelleher said.\n",
            "WMX last week reported a fourth-quarter loss of $461 million after charges, vs. a profit in the year-ago period of $49.6 million. It  reported revenues for all of 1996 of $9.18 billion, compared with $9.05 billion in 1995.\n",
            "WMX said Wednesday that the board nominees do not qualify for consideration at the company's annual meeting this year.\n",
            "\"The documents we received from the Soros group attempting to nominate four individuals for election as directors of the company arrived after the filing deadline and contained incomplete information,\" WMX said in a statement.\n",
            "WMX added that its board was committed to search for the best possible candidates and its nominating committee had agreed to consider the Soros nominees later this year.\n",
            "\"Our board is absolutely committed to attracting the best directors possible. We want to make sure we are serving the interests of all of our stockholders,\" WMX said.\n",
            "If Soros does not prevail before or during the WMX annual meeting scheduled for early May, time may be on his side.\n",
            "\"WMX is far from out of the woods and is likely going to have a few more painful quarters, which will strengthen Soros' hand so that he might succeed next time,\" Kelleher said.\n",
            "The WMX board said that Rooney, a long-time manager of the company's waste management business, was the right leader for the company as it concentrates on that industry.\n",
            "WMX also said an important component of its restructuring plan was adding new, independent perspectives to its board and reiterated it had hired an executive recruiting firm to find appropriate candidates.\n",
            "WMX's stock, which fell 9 percent last week, was up 50 cents at $32.75 in heavy volume on the New York Stock Exchange.\n",

            "Walt Disney Co.'s agreement to buy into billionaire Paul Allen's Starwave Corp. will mean little change for the online company's 300 employees, Chief Executive Officer Mike Slade said Thursday.\n",
            "In an interview, Slade said Starwave would continue producing its nine Internet sites including the hugely popular ESPNet SportZone as well as a new ABC News site that will go online this month.\n",
            "He said the long-expected announcement by Disney represented a natural evolution for Starwave, which has become one of the Internet's early success stories by focusing on sports and entertainment and teaming with well-known \"brand names.\"\n",
            "\"What's really important is the big traditional media company and the Internet company get their strategic and economic interests completely aligned, and they are,\" Slade said. \"These relationships are always complicated, but everyone's working for the exact same goal.\"\n",
            "Disney and Starwave did not provide financial details, but Slade said the deal reduces Allen, co-founder of Microsoft Corp., to a minority shareholder with a single representative on Starwave's new board, which will be controlled by Disney.\n",
            "Analysts said Disney paid about $100 million for a one-third stake, with a series of options to buy the rest over the next five years. Starwave employees also own shares.\n",
            "Starwave was founded by Allen and Slade in 1993, before the Internet emerged as a commercial publishing platform. The company explored interactive television before developing content for proprietary online services and CD-ROMs.\n",
            "\"Then the Web came along,\" said Slade, who credited the company's chief technology officer Patrick Naughton and Progressive Networks founder Rob Glaser with persuading him to adopt an Internet business plan.\n",
            "Starwave launched its sports product in late 1994 and signed the deal with ESPN -- now mostly owned by Disney -- the following spring.\n",
            "The ESPNet site is considered one of the Web's most popular and one of the few mainstream areas that charge for access.\n",
            "While basic sports results and information are free of charge, Slade said about 100,000 people pay to play in fantasy leagues or gain access to premium information at $4.95 a month.\n",
            "Starwave also operates Mr. Showbiz, a well-regarded entertainment site, as well as a site for parents and children and official sites for professional football, basketball and auto racing.\n",
            "Slade said Starwave's experience producing ESPNet would help in creating innovative features for the ABC News site.\n",
            "Despite competition with virtually every major news organization including CNN, USA Today and NBC's joint venture with Microsoft, Slade was optimistic Disney could make money in news.\n",
            "\"One of the things about Disney that makes them the ideal partner is they never do things in a lackadaisical way,\" Slade said. \"They marshal all the corporate resources and really make it happen.\"\n",

            "Humana Inc. reported lower quarterly profits Tuesday, mainly due to charges for restructuring, but the stock in the big health maintenance organisation rose on optimism over its new president's ambitious turnaround plan.\n",
            "The 4.9-million member HMO -- fifth largest in the United States among for-profit HMOs -- posted fourth-quarter net income of $22 million, or 13 cents a share, after charges, down from $49 million, or 30 cents a share, in the 1995 quarter.\n",
            "Quarterly premium revenues were $1.81 billion, up from $1.49 billion in the year-ago period.\n",
            "For the full year, Humana said net income plunged 94 percent to $12 million, or 7 cents a share, from $190 million, or $1.17 a share. The company reported revenues of $6.7 billion, up from $4.6 billion in 1995.\n",
            "The stock of the Louisville, Ky.-based Humana rose 37.5 cents to $18.75 on the New York Stock Exchange after rising as high as $19.25.\n",
            "\"What the stock is responding to is Humana's outlining a pretty aggressive action plan. ... They're making the organisation more lean and mean,\" said Gary Frazier, a health care industry analyst with the Bear Sterns brokerage.\n",
            "When Gregory Wolf became president of Humana in September, he took over a company that once had led the managed health care industry, but had more recently seen its star fade as it expanded into unprofitable areas.\n",
            "Wolf had previously been president of Emphesys Financial Group Inc., which Humana acquired in October 1995.\n",
            "With the help of a new executive staff, Wolf is pushing through a tough plan to cut costs and withdraw Humana from money-losing markets.\n",
            "\"He's made some very intelligent moves,\" said Ed Keaney, health-care industry analyst with the Volpe Welty brokerage.\n",
            "In the fourth quarter, Humana took a special charge against earnings of $10 million after taxes related mainly to severance costs for elimination of 700 to 900 jobs this year from its roughly 18,000-member work force.\n",
            "The company has sold or is selling money-losing operations in Alabama, Washington, D.C., and other markets.\n",
            "In the second quarter, Humana took a special charge against earnings of $130 million after taxes to restructure the Washington health plan, provide for expected insurance losses, close 13 service areas and discontinue unprofitable products in three markets.\n",
            "As a result, the company said total enrollment in its commercial health care plans fell by 69,100 members last year, by 87,500 members in January alone and is expected to decline by 115,000 members this quarter.\n",
            "\"Our plans to withdraw from certain markets and price business commensurate with the underlying risk are proceeding on schedule,\" Wolf said.\n",
            "The company's medical-loss ratio -- a key measure of profitability -- improved to 82.8 percent in the fourth quarter from 83.1 percent in the third quarter, but was up from 81.5 percent in the year-ago period.\n",
            "Analysts said they were impressed with Wolf's plan for reversing Humana's fortunes but noted the company unveiled a turnaround plan once before that was never fully achieved.\n",
            "\"I want to see a little more of a turn in earnings before I'm sure this action plan is taking hold,\" Frazier said.\n",

            "Officials from the world's biggest trading partners agreed Friday to push a deal on opening up financial services markets to the top of the agenda in talks to liberalise global trade.\n",
            "The leaders also emphasised the importance of bringing China and Russia into the World Trade Organisation as quickly as possible \"on commercially viable terms.\"\n",
            "The financial services talks are \"the most urgent, major priority in terms of negotiations for the world trade community,\" Leon Brittan, European Union Trade Commissioner, told a news conference after two days of talks between the so-called Quad partners -- Canada, Japan, the United States and the European Union.\n",
            "\"I believe that the Quad meeting has given a shot in the arm\" to negotiations on financial services, Brittan said.\n",
            "The Quad members agreed to put forward requests by mid-June and offers no later than July 14 to work towards a financial services deal. They hope to wrap up negotiations in December.\n",
            "\"That should be an example to the rest of the world and a platform on which to build,\" Brittan said.\n",
            "But he and the other leaders pointed out the need for countries in Asia and Latin America to put together improved offers to the World Trade Organisation. Last year the United States pulled out of talks on financial services because of its disappointment in the offers from other countries.\n",
            "U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, in a letter last week to a number of his counterparts, said a successful financial services pact must include provisions that allow firms to operate in other countries in the form of their choice.\n",
            "It must also allow full majority ownership and assure existing rights of foreign financial services providers, he said.\n",
            "The four trading chiefs also called for bringing China and Russia into the World Trade Organisation quickly.\n",
            "The Quad members said they were united in their belief that China, in particular, should be brought into the global trading forum as long as Beijing committed itself to the global trading system and open market access.\n",
            "\"We are not going to push on the accelerator for political reasons, and we are not going to put on the brakes for political reasons,\" Brittan said.\n",
            "Officials said the Quad members would like new members, especially China, to sign on to a recent pact to eliminate tariffs on various information technologies by 2000.\n",
            "The forum provided an opportunity for the four countries to discuss bilateral trade issues with each other.\n",
            "The European Union expressed concern about the implementation of a 1992 agreement with the United States limiting subsidies to aircraft industries.\n",
            "\"We do not accept that proposition at all, at the same time the United States has some concerns about European practices,\" U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky told reporters after a morning meeting with Brittan.\n",
            "Barshefsky said U.S. and EU officials would continue discussions on the issue in June, but that the United States would not agree to any emergency consultations.\n",
            "Barshefsky also had a strong word with Canadian Trade Minister Art Eggleton over Canada's new copyright law which taxes blank cassettes and distributes the royalties to performers. U.S. performers, however, will not receive any money since the United States has not signed an international copyright agreement.\n",
            "\"We think there is a national treatment problem here,\" Barshefsky said, referring to one country's preferential treatment for its citizens. She said the United States would consider taking trade action against Canada over the law.\n",
            "But Eggleton said Canada was well within its rights and obligations with the copyright law.\n",

            "\"We're asking for all parties to sit down and discuss and peacefully negotiate a resolution to this,\" Christine Stewart, Canada's secretary of state for Latin America and Africa, told the House of Commons. \"We believe that the Africans themselves must come to a peaceful resolution to this problem.\"\n",
            "Canada's stand contrasted with that of the United States, which signalled on Wednesday that Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko should step down.\n",
            "Rebel forces now control almost half the territory in Zaire, the largest country in central Africa. Although he is under siege and suffering from prostate cancer, Mobuto is clinging to power and has declared a state of emergency in the capital Kinshasa and the rest of the country.\n",
            "\"The government of Canada is not asking the president to leave the country at this time,\" Stewart said. \"Canada believes that Africans have to resolve their problems. Obviously Western-imposed solutions in this area of the world have not succeeded in the past.\"\n",
            "She encouraged the countries around Zaire to help it resolve its problems.\n",
            "Earlier on Wednesday, Washington effectively ended a decades-old alliance with Mobutu. White House spokesman Mike McCurry said a negotiated soloution to Zaire's civil war must include agreements on interim transitional government arrangements leading ultimately to elections.\n",
            "\"That clearly reflects our view that Mobutuism is about to become a creature of history, because the support for President Mobutu is not sufficient to lead Zaire into the next chaprter of its history,\" McCurry told reporters.\n",
            "Late last year, Canadian soldiers led a multinational force into eastern Zaire to aid Rwandan refugees fleeing after a revolt by Zairean rebels.\n",
            "The Canadian-led force was able to do little more than coordinate data from aerial searches for refugees and prepare plans for aid airdrops.\n",

            "Coles, which pockets nearly 18 cents in every retail dollar spent in Australia, reported a net profit of A$273.6 million for half-year ended January 26, against A$194.5 million a year ago.  \n",

            "Ivory Coast, a beacon of economic and political stability in West Africa, has become a magnet for stowaways from neighbouring states -- especially Nigeria, Ghana and war-ravaged Liberia.\n",

            "\"Stowaways slip on board from the lagoons at night or climb over port walls,\" said an Ivorian Transport Ministry spokesman. \"How to stop them is purely a police matter.\"\n",

            "Investigators say many cases probably go unreported. \"If bodies are found at sea they are reported at the destination port but some are probably thrown overboard,\" one said.\n",
            "Shipping agents say port security is very low on the list of priorities in the African countries concerned. Posting extra port guards is costly and of little value when guards can be bribed to turn a blind eye.\n",
            "\"All African ports suffer from the same problem,\" said a ship surveyor who has worked in most of Africa's principal ports for over 25 years. \"We always have a number of cases in hand.\"\n",

            "Dade County Circuit Court Judge Robert Kaye said during a hearing that even if tobacco companies were found liable by a jury for injuries caused by secondhand smoke, the claims of an estimated 60,000 plaintiffs might be too cumbersome for a single trial.  \n",
            "Kaye said determining the direct linkage of secondhand smoke to individual ailments and setting the amounts due each of the non-smoking flight attendants covered by the Broin suit might be nearly impossible.\n",

            "The judge, who is also weighing a tobacco-industry request that fraud and conspiracy allegations be dropped from the suit, gave no indication when he might rule. Another pre-trial hearing was scheduled for Friday.  \n",
            "Kaye five years ago knocked down the class-action status of the Broin case, first filed in 1991, but was overturned three years ago by a Florida appeals court, which ordered a trial after hearing tobacco company arguments the case was too cumbersome.\n",

            "The Broin case, named after American Airlines flight attendant Norma Broin, alleges that cigarette smoke aboard U.S. passenger jets caused the lung cancer and other ailments of thousands of non-smoking flight attendants. In-flight smoking in the United States was banned in 1988.\n",
            "In court on Thursday, tobacco company lawyers asked Kaye to end the class-action status of the Broin suit and said each of the claims needed to be tried individually, since many factors beyond cigarette smoke may have caused the flight attendants' injuries.  \n",

            "The parliamentary statement of approval for the declaration -- which includes a separate clause implying, in part, that post-war property restitution questions against the Czechs are closed --  was carried by 131 votes to 59.\n",
            "Germany's parliament had already approved the declaration in January by a large majority.\n",
            "The Czech debate over the sensitive agreement turned ugly at times amid stalling tactics by ultra-right Republican and Communist opposition deputies who see the pact as a sellout to Bonn, and who were trying to obstruct a final vote.\n",
            "Approval of the declaration, expected to pass easily in the Czech upper house, is seen by the Prague government as a prerequisite for NATO and EU membership.\n",
            "The pact also seals Germany's final post-war reconciliation with a neighbouring country.\n",
            "The agreement expresses Bonn's regrets for the 1938-45 Nazi occupation of the Czech lands, and Prague's sorrow for Czech brutality in the post-war expulsion of 2.5 million ethnic Germans.\n",
            "While the bilateral agreement sets up a fund for general victim compensation programmes, it does not directly deal with the thorny issue of restitution to expropriated ethnic Germans. Instead it says the issue should never again become a political consideration.\n",
            "The parliamentary preamble approved with the declaration makes reference to speeches by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec introducing the measure this week in which both insist that post-war property restitution questions are closed.\n",
            "Bonn insisted after the agreement was signed that individual property claims can still be made, but Klaus and Zieleniec both rejected this.\n",
            "The largest opposition party, the Social Democrats (CSSD), demanded that references to the introductory speeches by Klaus and Zieleniec be included in the preamble -- especially because of their comments on property issues -- to ensure a large majority in favour of the declaration.\n",
            "The preamble says simply that parliament, \"after listening to the prime minister... and foreign minister, and on the basis of the government's reasoning\", agrees with the declaration \"which expresses the will of both states to prevent the past from troubling the joint European future.\"\n",
            "Zieleniec said after the vote (corrects from \"after the speech\") that the preamble, which may raise eyebrows in southern Germany where most of the expellees now live, was not aimed at any specific issue, despite the CSSD's protests.\n",

            "But the company was quick to emphasise that no jobs were under threat.\n",
            "\"Provided we meet our overall strategic objectives there won't be any compulsory redundancies. There is no hidden agenda here to lose jobs,\" said Andy Homer, manager of Commercial Union's UK general insurance division.\n",
            "Dubbed 'Market Orientation', the changes will see head office functions reorganised into customer-focused trading units built around specific market segments and distribution channels, the company said.\n",
            "There will be nine new trading units, each focused on one market sector. They will handle product development, underwriting, marketing and delivery.\n",
            "Underwriters, marketers, finance and information technology staff will all work in teams, with the task of focusing on customer needs and Commercial Union believes it is the first British insurer to take this cross-functional approach.\n",
            "\"Market Orientation will create an innovative, team-based commercial culture and ensure that we establish ourselves as the pre-eminent force in the UK insurance market,\" said Cees Schrauwers, managing director of Commercial Union non-life insurance.\n",
            "The company hopes to save 40 million pounds through more effective management of the claims supply chain, which accounts for five percent of the 800 million pound annual claims bill.\n",
            "It already has a sole supplier agreement for windshields with Autoglass.\n",
            "The benefits will be shared by customers as well as shareholders, Schrauwers said.\n",

            "\"Earnings per share will jump about 50 percent over the next three years,\" Currie told the annual meeting. First- quarter profit rose to C$0.15 a share for the period ended March 22 from year earlier C$0.12.\n",
            "Currie also told shareholders that 1997 earnings per share would rise to C$0.85 to C$0.89, the range of predictions by analysts. \"My expectations are (that) the analysts are about correct,\" he said.\n",
            "Last year, Loblaw, which is 70 percent-owned by bakery group George Weston Ltd, earned C$0.72 a share or C$173.7 million on sales of C$9.85 billion.\n",
            "Currie forecast 1997 sales would expand by 10 percent. \"Sales have been very solid, up seven percent last year, and with this year being a 53-week year, it might hit to 10 percent,\" Currie added. \"That would represent a stellar year.\"\n",
            "Loblaw ended its previous fiscal year in December 28 but because it reports in 12-week increments, it must add a few days this year.\n",
            "\"The earnings have a potential to increase more if we can get our costs down to where they could be,\" Currie said. In 1996, Loblaw streamlined warehousing and distribution systems.\n",
            "Loblaw, which owns retail and wholesale stores including Loblaws, Valu-Mart, Extra Foods and Lucky Dollar Foods, has seen sales grow steadily over the past few years as it expanded in Atlantic Canada and other regions.\n",
            "The grocer plans to unveil its first Quebec stores, outside of its outlets in the Ottawa/Hull region, in late 1997 or early 1998.\n",
            "Loblaw has also benefited from the strike of unionized workers at 73 Safeway Inc stores in Alberta, which began on March 26, Currie added. Loblaw sales have jumped 30 percent in the province.\n",
            "Safeway is based in Pleasanton, California.\n",
            "Currie said Loblaw would have C$450 million in capital expenditures in 1997, up from about C$350 million in 1996. He said Loblaw planned to open or renovate 64 outlets.\n",

            "\"China's membership in the WTO is unlikely to be settled this year,\" General Chamber of Commerce chairman James Tien told reporters after returning from meetings in Beijing with Chinese Premier Li Peng and the top Chinese official responsible for Hong Kong affairs, Lu Ping.\n",
            "A number of outstanding issues with the United States remain. These concern the opening of the Chinese market, particularly in the area of services, and would probably delay China's WTO membership, Peng told the delegation.\n",
            "But relations with Britain were poised to improve following the May 1 election of Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labour government, ending 18 years of Conservative rule.\n",
            "\"(Li said) he looked forward to a better relationship with the Labour government in the UK and that would help Hong Kong's transition after July 1,\" Tien said.\n",
            "Former Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher was responsible for the 1984 Sino-British treaties governing the return of Hong Kong to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30, ending 156 years of British colonial rule.\n",
            "Tien also revealed that China did not support attempts to tighten visa requirements for foreigners or restrict their right to work in the territory -- a proposal made in a private member's bill tabled by Hong Kong unionist legislator Chan Yuen-han.\n",
            "\"The Chinese government was not supportive of that position,\" Tien said.\n",
            "The issue was raised in a discussion about Hong Kong's continued competitiveness, said chamber member Eden Woon. Attempts would be made to remove uncompetitive tax treatment for foreign firms investing in China through Hong Kong, he added.\n",

            "Supporters of the House bill say it would help make public-housing residents less reliant on government programmes. And they argue it would encourage tenants to assume a greater role in their community. Unemployed tenants would have to perform community service without pay -- a provision Democrats liken to slavery.\n",

            "The House and Senate passed separate bills in 1996 but failed to iron out a compromise before Congress adjourned.\n",
            "The new bill covers the nearly seven million people living in public housing or receiving rental aid. Today, the federal government contracts with the nation's 3,400 public housing authorities, which own and operate the housing developments.\n",
            "In exchange for federal dollars, housing authorities run the programmes under close scrutiny from the federal government.\n",

            "-- Mandate that 35 percent of public housing residents be among the very poor with incomes of no more than 30 percent of a community's median income. Current law has a 75 percent ceiling on the number of extremely poor residents.\n",
            "-- Require able-bodied, unemployed persons who live in public housing or who receive rental assistance to perform eight hours a month of community service or get job training.\n",
            "-- Allow tenants to pay either a flat rent or an amount up to 30 percent of their income. Supporters argue the existing system, which links a tenant's rent to income, creates a disincentive to work because rent increases with income.\n",

            "In June 1994, when Sanofi wanted to buy the Sterling Winthrop business from Eastman Kodak, Jaffre agreed with the $1.68 billion acquisition on condition that Sanofi sold assets for the same amount. Dehecq was forced to part with Sanofi's bio-activities and some lacklustre perfume brands.\n",
            "Jaffre was appointed chairman and chief executive of Elf in 1993 when it was still under state control and he oversaw the privatisation of the group in 1994. The sale of a 64 percent stake in Elf for 385 francs per share generated 14.9 billion francs, representing the biggest privatisation to date.\n",
            "But Elf reported its first ever loss that year, of 5.4 billion francs, after Jaffre took an 8.7 billion charge to clean up the balance sheet and write off overvalued oil reserves and the Texas Gulf phosphate business.\n",
            "He said he aimed to sell 15 billion francs of industrial assets and six billion of financial assets to cut the debt which stood at 46 percent of equity. Most of this programme has been carried out, company sources said.\n",
            "Jaffre cut investment in the ambitious Leuna refinery project in former East Germany, sold stakes in Entreprise Oil in Britain and Petrofina in Belgium and most recently a stake in Compagnie de Suez.\n",

            "British leisure and brewery group Whitbread Plc said on Thursday it had appointed David Thomas as its chief executive designate to take over from Peter Jarvis who is to step down next summer.\n",
            "Thomas's appointment was viewed by the investment community as a natural progression from the Jarvis era, which saw Whitbread aggressively transform itself from a brewer to a diversified leisure company in less than six years.\n",
            "Since 1985, Whitbread has changed its business mix. Beer now only accounts for 14 percent of profits, with the rest coming from its managed estates, restaurant and leisure arm.\n",
            "Analysts expect Thomas to press ahead with Whitbread's expansion into the leisure and restaurant business while retaining its interest in brewing.\n",
            "\"It's just going to be basically more of the same, he's going to continue to take them down the retail, leisure route,\" said Charles Winston, an analyst at BZW.\n",
            "A slide in Whitbread shares, down 12.5p at 763p, was attributed more to profit-taking than any disappointment at the new executive appointment.\n",
            "\"It's more of a tribute to Jarvis than a thumbs down for Thomas. They have also had a very good run up of late,\" said one analyst who declined to be named.\n",
            "\"We knew he was going to leave before retirement age although these announcements are always a bit of a surprise when they come,\" said John Beaumont, an analyst at Merrill Lynch.\n",
            "But he added: \"The appointment of David Thomas seems like a natural progression for the company.\"\n",
            "Thomas, who was appointed to the main board in 1991 and took over the restaurant and leisure division in 1992, is credited with accelerating the development of Whitbread's existing brands -- Travel Inn, restaurants TGI Friday's and Beefeater.\n",
            "He was also the architect of Whitbread's drive into the pub food market through Brewers Fayre.\n",

            "Anglo-Dutch consumer products group Unilever NV/Plc reported a 15 percent rise in annual profits on Tuesday and put its speciality chemicals units up for sale in a move tipped to raise up to 5 billion British pounds ($8.17 billion).\n",
            "Pre-tax profit rose to 2.66 billion pounds ($4.4 billion) on a 6 percent rise in revenues to 33.52 billion ($54.7 billion). 2.\n",
            "Unilever shares surged on the results, which were better than analysts had forecast, and on the planned speciality chemicals sale.\n",
            "Unilever Plc shares surged 86-1/2 pence to 1,479-1/2 ($24.17) in London as some looked to raise 1997 forecasts.\n",
            "Chairman Niall FitzGerald said the sale of the speciality chemicals businesses would enable the group to concentrate on achieving growth in its consumer goods operations, particularly in developing and emerging markets.\n",
            "Analysts said the sale, which could free Unilever up for a major acquisition in its main food, detergents and personal products businesses, was well timed.\n",
            "FitzGerald said, meanwhile, that the overall economic situation in 1997, as in 1996, was likely to be generally favourable for the group, which is the world's largest producer of both margarine and ice cream, with activities from food to toiletries.\n",
            "But he saw little reason to believe that conditions in Europe, particularly in France and Germany, would improve.\n",
            "\"We will now seek actively buyers for the totality or the individual (chemicals) businesses and we will then assess those over the next month or two,\" FitzGerald told Reuters. \"We would hope to conclude a sale in the course of the next three to six months.\"\n",
            "FitzGerald declined to say how much the businesses, with 15,800 staff in more than 35 countries, might be worth.\n",
            "Analysts estimate the sale should fetch 4.5 billion to 5 billion pounds ($7.35 billion to 8.17 billion), and FitzGerald told a news conference in the short term it would wipe out the company's net borrowings of 1.7 billion pounds ($2.78 billion).\n",
            "The funds would also be used for acquisitions in growth areas, FitzGerald told reporters, such as Asia Pacific and South America and in priority categories like detergents, tea, ice cream, yellow fats, personal care products and fragrances.\n",
            "\"We have a carefully defined list of what we may do with (the proceeds), which I am not prepared to discuss,\" he said. \"In China I would like to have a business 10 times the size.\"\n",
            "The four units -- National Starch and Chemical Company, Quest International, Unichema International and Crosfield -- have combined turnover of 3 billion pounds ($4.9 billion), 9 percent of Unilever's total sales, and showed operating profit of 415 million ($678 million) in 1996, with margins of 14.1 percent.\n",
            "\"These are extremely large and important parts of our businesses but for some time we have been reviewing whether they should be a continuing part of the portfolio -- not because they are poorly performing themselves, they are excellent performers -- but whether we can give them the concentration and the focus that they require,\" FitzGerald said.\n",
            "\"...if you look at the way this industry is developing we have to take a decision either to significantly improve our presence in these markets, perhaps double it, or to exit and in exiting to concentrate on the other 90 percent of our business which is our mainstream consumer goods business.\"\n",
            "Commenting on the overall results, Unilever said its performance in Europe was held back by poor weather hitting ice cream sales and by the impact of the mad cow disease crisis.\n",
            "But good progress in North American market conditions provided the basis for better results there and the momentum of growth continued strongly in the fast-growing emerging markets.\n",

            "McDonald's Corp. just turned up the heat in the fast-food business.\n",
            "If franchisees go along with the plan, the world's largest restaurant chain will launch its biggest nationwide promotion ever, featuring 55-cent sandwiches, down from about $1.95 for a Big Mac, according to franchisee sources.\n",
            "The plan is a bold step to lure customers into McDonald's restaurants in the face of intense competition in the nation's $100 billion fast-food business, industry analysts said.\n",
            "McDonald's, which has more than 20,000 units worldwide and more than 12,000 in the United States, declined to give specifics on its plan. Spokesman Jack Daly said the Oak Brook, Ill.-based company hopes to launch a \"national value-price promotion.\"\n",
            "Pointing to a current promotion on Chicken McNugget sandwiches, which analysts said has helped McDonald's build sales this month, Daly said, \"It's in that same spirit.\"\n",
            "Charles Gonzales, a McDonald's franchisee with two units in the San Francisco area, said the nationwide promotion would feature a different sandwich for 55 cents each month when a customer buys french fries and a drink at the regular price.\n",
            "The promotion, he added, is expected to start with the Big Mac hamburger, which is usually priced between $1.90 and $1.99, and will include breakfast sandwiches as well, he said.\n",
            "But the promotion, to be presented to franchisees on Thursday, could spark a price war, analysts said. That prospect worried investors who drove fast-food stocks sharply lower.\n",
            "\"Everyone will have something for 55 cents. Now it's a zero-sum game again,\" said Piper Jaffray analyst Allan Hickok.\n",
            "But Dean Witter analyst David Adelman said Wendy's International Inc. and Burger King, a unit of Grand Metropolitan Plc, may not match McDonald's price promotions right away.\n",
            "\"There are a lot of things (companies can do) to enhance value without directly cutting prices,\" Adelman said, including increasing the frequency of regular promotions.\n",
            "Earlier, Burger King said it had no plans to change its prices. Wendy's officials were not immediately available.\n",
            "McDonald's stock tumbled $2.625 to $44.625 and Wendy's slid $1.50 to $20.75 on the New York Stock Exchange, where the shares were among the most active issues. American shares of Britain's Grand Metropolitan Plc, which owns Burger King, fell $1 to $30.625, also on the NYSE.\n",
            "Dean Witter's Adelman said it remained to be seen if the McDonald's plan will bring in more customers. \"We have much more jaded consumers today,\" he said, noting price cuts were not \"new news.\"\n",
            "Gonzales noted some franchisees oppose price promotions since they often do not boost customer traffic enough to offset lower sandwich prices. Moreover, regular customers may be tempted to order whatever sandwich is being offered that month instead of higher-priced menu items, he said.\n",
            "Daly, however, said increased sales volume is expected to offset lower menu prices. \"Margins (are) a function of volume,\" he added.\n",
            "Dick Adams, chairman of the Consortium, an independent association of McDonald's franchisees, said he expected the promotion plan to be approved.\n",
            "\"They (franchisees) are going to vote for it,\" Adams said. \"They are being told that it's the only plan that is available.\"\n",
            "He said McDonald's was expected to present the plan in a satellite broadcast to operators across the country on Thursday.\n",
            "McDonald's has been looking to boost domestic sales, which have been pressured because of competition. In a December 1996 memo to owners and operators, Jack Greenberg, chairman of McDonald's U.S.A. said, \"We must re-energise and focus our U.S. marketing efforts and develop a national value proposition.\"\n",

            "\"Superwoman\" fund manager Nicola Horlick announced her resignation on Thursday from Deutsche Morgan Grenfell (DMG), leaving what she called a feeling of \"turmoil\" among fund managers at the German-owned bank.\n",
            "A spokesman for Horlick, who had been head of British pension fund business at DMG's Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM), told Reuters she had quit and was planning legal action against her former employer over \"constructive dismissal\".\n",
            "Horlick had been suspended on Tuesday pending the outcome of an internal investigation into what Deutsche Morgan Grenfell described as \"a potential breach of her contract\".\n",
            "The dispute was believed to revolve around allegations Horlick was looking to move and take staff with her. It follows a scandal last year at MGAM over misvaluations in three of its funds and the subsequent sacking of fund manager Peter Young.\n",
            "The suspension of Horlick, dubbed superwoman in financial circles because of her ability to hold a high-powered job while looking after five children, prompted reports of unease among large pension fund clients at the firm.\n",
            "The row erupted only days after Horlick received news of a promotion to managing director from MGAM chief executive Robert Smith, a banking source said. \"They shook hands on it last Friday,\" the source said.\n",
            "Horlick, in an interview with the Financial Times published on Friday, described disquiet at MGAM over the Young affair. She said the promotion came after a group of fund managers who worked under her said they would leave the company unless she be given more authority.\n",
            "\"They demanded that I be given more authority. They felt that things were in turmoil following the Peter Young affair.\"\n",
            "Young, currently under investigation by Britain's Serious Fraud Office, has denied any involvement in criminal activity.\n",
            "The Horlick saga is said to have unsettled pension fund clients at DMG, but the company said earlier on Thursday that it did not expect any exodus of its pension fund clients.\n",
            "Banking sources also said DMG was confident other fund managers would not follow in Horlick's footsteps and that there was a climate of loyalty to MGAM's Smith.\n",
            "But DMG has been in the spotlight for months over the Peter Young affair, which has been costly as well as embarassing. In December Deutsche Bank agreed to a compensation package of around 200 million pounds ($335 million) to make good losses suffered by investors. Deutsche also saw its coveted triple-A credit rating from Moody's dropped last month.\n",
            "In October Deutsche named Rolf Breuer, a 58-year-old investment banker, as its new head. Breuer will take over on May 20 and is expected to fight hard to avoid the criticism and mistrust that dogged his predecessor Hilmar Kopper.\n",
            "Kopper never managed to shrug off the \"peanuts\" tag attached to him in 1994 after he used the word to describe losses caused by the collapse of the Schneider property empire, with which Deutsche was closely involved.\n",
            "Peanuts are just about the last word the British press have been using in connection with Horlick. She was reported to have earned one million pounds ($1.68 million) a year.\n",

            "There has been press speculation Horlick was preparing a move to Dutch bank ABN AMRO with others in her team, but ABN has denied any attempt of poaching a fund manager team. It declined to say whether it had tried to hire Horlick.\n",

            "Russia's plans to cut electricity tariffs for good payers could jolt its giant aluminium industry, the world's largest exporter of the non-ferrous metal, into bigger profits, officials and analysts said on Monday.\n",
            "But not all plants, they said, would benefit equally.\n",
            "\"Well, this is certainly a pretty good development,\" said Galina Stelmakova, deputy director for development and investments at Kontsern Alyuminiy, the Russian producers' group. \"It will streamline the economic situations at smelters.\n",
            "Fuel and Energy Minister Boris Nemtsov, in charge of revamping natural monopolies in the energy and transport sectors, said earlier that electricity tariffs for domestic industry would drop by up to 30 percent from July.\n",
            "Nemtsov said only users which paid on time for supplies would be eligible for the lower tariffs -- a condition many, but not all, Russian smelters meet.\n",
            "Industry officials said that with electricity accounting for about 25 percent of the cost of producing a tonne of primary aluminium in Russia, lower power tariffs could help profits.\n",
            "Yuri Shlaifshtein, a board member at Bratsk, the world's largest primary aluminium smelter, said leaner tariffs could help the Siberian plant's longterm plans to attract foreign investment for modernisation.\n",
            "\"I can only welcome this decision,\" he said by telephone, adding Bratsk always paid on time, in cash, for its electricity supplies. \"This won't affect our general production levels but it will make them more stable over the longterm.\"\n",
            "Russia, home to the world's largest smelters, exported 2.44 million tonnes of primary aluminium last year, the most of any producing country. Its total output was 2.87 million tonnes.\n",
            "The reduction in power costs are not likely to be felt evenly, since different regions have different rates. The so-called European part of Russia, where only about 15 percent of Russia's aluminium is produced, pays the highest tariffs.\n",
            "Irkutsk, another large East Siberian smelter, pays about 10 percent of its per-tonne production cost of $1,200 for electricity. In sharp contrast, the European smelters pay up to $600 for electricity for each tonne.\n",
            "Boris Arlyuk of St Petersburg, Russia-based Alumconsult said the rate cuts would help the Kandalaksha, Nadvoisky and Volgograd smelters in the European part of Russia most of all, since those plants had the highest energy costs.\n",
            "But they were also the least solvent, paying for electricity with metal or promissory notes, and might not be able to produce cash up front as Nemtsov wanted, he said.\n",
            "Russian smelters are struggling to secure longterm electricity supply contracts to increase profits and plan for the future.\n",
            "Nemstov's rate cuts are part of a wider drive by Moscow to spark life into industrial output in general, which has plummeted in the years since the breakup of the Soviet Union.\n",
            "Ironically, electricity rate cuts could benefit the Siberian smelters the least, since some of them may have already secured longterm supply contracts with regional hydroelectrical plants.\n",
            "\"Now if we can just get the government to agree to a lower tariff for three years,\" Shlaifshtein added. \"And then get it to do the same thing for railway tariffs.\"\n",
            "Nemtsov, a young reformer who is also a first deputy prime minister, has also promised to cut rail tariffs -- a move the smelters would welcome.\n",
            "Industry officials have said the cost of transporting Russian metal to world markets is more than twice the Western industry average of around 24 percent.\n",
            "Kontsern Alyuminiy said in March that average Russian smelter profit margins had fallen to one percent in 1996 from 16 percent two years before.\n",

            "Despite the prospect of tougher conditions, Bond said the banking group, which is one of the biggest in the world, had a strong capital position and a balance sheet that made it ready to meet competition head-on.\n",

            "Midland put in a strong performance with pretax profits up more than 20 percent and costs held to a rise of less than 1 percent.\n",

            "\"As long as we're making a respectable return on capital, we regard capital strength as an asset in our business,\" Bond said. \"It helps you with the ratings, it helps with deposits in Asia and to have a strong capital position shows in the bottom line.\"\n",

            "In an interview with Reuters, Dollens said, \"We don't think it's material. We can't imagine it would be more than $1 million for us, even as a top-line phenomenon, because we feel we'll be back on the market in four to six weeks in Europe.\"\n",

            "About 200 of the devices have been implanted in people since the Ventak AV was approved for sale in Europe in November. It is not approved for sale in the United States.\n",
            "The problem with the device is mechanical and cannot be fixed by reprogramming, Dollens said. Depending on the patient, if a problem is present and needs to be fixed, removal and replacement would be necessary, he said.\n",

            "If Miss Manners, the nation's arbiter of proper taste and decorum, can find good things to say about car dealers, then the industry must be doing something right.\n",
            "That was the message John Peterson, outgoing president of the National Automobile Dealers Association, delivered on Saturday in a speech that railed against the media and others who say traditional car dealerships are on the way out.\n",
            "\"It's time we stood up for what our industry is doing right out there,\" said Peterson. \"So, to our friends in the media, I say take a tip from one of your own, Miss Manners, and park that old stereotype of fast-talking salesmen in plaid coats and white bucks.\"\n",
            "According to Peterson, Miss Manners, whose real name is Judith Martin, wrote a column in 1996 after she shopped for a new car in which she said she was \"astonished\" at the \"dignified courtesy\" she found at a dozen dealerships she visted.\n",
            "Peterson spoke at the opening day of the NADA's 80th annual convention and equipment exposition.\n",
            "In his remarks, Peterson acknowledged the traditional dealer franchise system is facing numerous challenges from the explosive growth of used car superstores such as CarMax and AutoNation USA.\n",
            "But he said traditional franchised dealers will remain the dominant system for selling new cars and trucks. In a year when the superstores grew rapidly, Peterson said franchised dealers boosted sales by three percent, increased profits by 25 percent, and finished the year with 23,000 dealerships in operation.\n",
            "Of the approximately 15 million new light vehicles expected to be sold in 1997, 14.5 million will be sold by the current franchise system.\n",
            "Peterson also took issue with critics who say car dealers do not respond to customers, saying a recent survey by the Newspaper Association of America indicated that more than 90 percent of new-vehicle buyers are satisified or very satisfied.\n",
            "\"No business is more poked at, picked at, anaylzed, written about and castigated for failing to live up to performance standards that no other business in the country is expected to meet,\" said Peterson.\n",
            "In the NADA's keynote speech, Toyota Motor Corp's top executive in the U.S. told the audience that franchised new-car dealers will continue to be the cornerstone of the U.S. automotive retailing industry.\n",
            "Yale Gieszel, executive vice president of Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc, said consumers -- and not auto superstores -- are driving the changes rocking the business.\n",
            "\"Large retail chains or automobile department stores are not the answer to the challenges we face. The current franchise system will not only survive, it will flourish,\" he said.\n",
            "At a news conference afterward, Gieszel said he does not believe the large superstore chains can reap enough economies of scale that they can outperform local franchises. Gieszel also said Toyota is not convinced the large superstores can offer the close customer attention that individual dealers can.\n",

            "The government's latest airwaves auction looks likely to generate far less money for Uncle Sam than the $1.8 billion Congress was counting on to help balance the budget, regulators said over the weekend.\n",
            "By late Friday, the auction -- for a slice of spectrum that will allow users to gain access to the Internet over the airwaves or create wireless local phone networks -- had raised just $12.1 million.\n",
            "\"It's definitely not going to meet budget expectations,\" Federal Communications Commission Chairman Reed Hundt said in an interview Friday.\n",
            "The sale began Tuesday. FCC officials said bidding among the 23 companies -- including units of BellSouth Corp., Comcast Corp. and a Bell Atlantic Corp./Nynex Corp. joint venture -- appears to be winding down.\n",
            "Analysts argued that the low total underscores the point that spectrum sales will probably not be the \"golden goose\" that lawmakers and the Clinton administration have looked to for eliminating the budget deficit.\n",
            "\"It's nice to think of it as government property that would earn the country some money,\" said analyst David Roddy of Deloitte &amp; Touche Consulting Group. \"But the sale of the spectrum was too much and too fast.\"\n",
            "Said Elliott Hamilton, an analyst at Strategis Group, a Washington-based consulting firm: \"It's not an endless supply of gold out there at the end of the rainbow.\"\n",
            "\"Congress, the White House and the FCC have to sit down and start rationalising their approach to spectrum.\"\n",
            "The \"wireless communications services\" or WCS auction is the FCC's 14th airwaves sale. Potential applications for the spectrum include broadband wireless access to the Internet, wireless local phone networks, and location services for pinpointing trucks and other vehicles.\n",
            "The auctions have netted the government about $23 billion, far more than expected. But prices have begun to slide as more spectrum is sold, contributing to financial problems among wireless carriers and raising doubts over whether Uncle Sam ever will collect all the money it is owed.\n",
            "Looking ahead, the Clinton administration proposed in its 1998 budget to raise $36.1 billion by selling licenses to firms wanting to sell new ways to link to the Internet or send video images through the air, among other possible services.\n",
            "\"They're not going to make that,\" predicted Roddy of Deloitte &amp; Touche.\n",
            "Indeed, the WCS sale offered a new twist. In its zeal to balance the budget, Congress last year required the FCC to hold the auction by April 15 and to collect the proceeds by Sept. 30, the last day of the 1997 fiscal year.\n",
            "FCC officials said the timetable has contributed to the meagre returns. Potential bidders, communications-equipment manufacturers and wireless investors were not given enough time to fully analyse the auction, they said.\n",
            "\"This is exactly why we told Congress we should always have at least a year's advance notice,\" said Hundt, adding that his agency was given less than five months.\n",
            "Some on Capitol Hill are eyeing the problem.\n",
            "Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican who heads the commerce committee, plans to offer a bill soon to try and maximize the money the government raises in auctions.\n",
            "To prevent spectrum from being dumped on the market, the bill would allow for a \"reasonable time lag\" between the allocation of the spectrum and its sale by the FCC.\n",
            "The nation's broadcasters, in the transition to digital television, are using recent auction woes as evidence that they should not have to hand back their analogue TV licenses by the year 2006. The permits would be auctioned for other uses.\n",
            "\"Such proposals will undermine our ability to meet the challenges of moving our nation into the digital future, and will simply not be achievable on the revenue side,\" the National Association of Broadcasters told lawmakers.\n",
            "Hundt disagrees. \"Everyone who has spectrum wants to make sure that no one else ever gets any.\"\n",

            "Revenue for the quarter ended Feb. 28 rose 30 percent to $786.8 million from $606 million a year ago.\n",
            "3Com makes electronic devices that send information through computer networks. In December, the company had unusually weak sales because of falling product prices and aggressive moves by competitors Cisco and Intel Corp.\n",
            "The warning set off a month-long slide of networking stocks and spurred concerns that the industry segment had seen its best days. Since the warning, 3Com's shares have lost more than half their value in seven weeks.\n",

            "\"It looks like the worst is behind them, although it could take at least a quarter or two for them to get things back in line,\" said Noel Lindsey, analyst at investment bank Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Inc. in San Francisco.\n",
            "Benhamou's positive remarks also likely will boost 3Com's stock Friday, Lindsey said.\n",
            "About 45 percent of 3Com's revenue comes from the sale of networking adapter cards, the graham-wafer-sized devices that plug into PCs to connect them to networks. 3Com said adapter card revenue rose 39 percent in the third quarter to $346.3 million.\n",
            "3Com also sells switches and hubs, the devices that shuffle information through networks. Sales of these system products rose 24 percent to $432.6 million.\n",
            "Benhamou said the company is bringing expenses in line with revenue. He also said strong sales throughout Asia is offsetting weakness in Japan. Similarly, strong British sales are mitigating weak sales in Germany, he said.\n",
            "\"During the quarter, we saw strong demand for our high-end\" network equipment, 3Com Chairman Eric Benhamou said in a statement, \"and the number of multimillion-dollar orders we received from large accounts has never been greater.\"\n",
            "\"At the same time, our industry is in the midst of many important transitions,\" Benhamou added, citing the adoption of higher-speed technologies, new methods for directing network traffic and pricing and distribution increasingly based on volume sales.\n",
            "He said that as a result of these changes, 3Com's results in the latest quarter reflected increased price competition and a pause in industry demand as corporate networking customers and network service providers assess how to maximize their investments in computer networks.\n",
            "But he added the changes were \"positive for 3Com and the industry in the long run.\"\n",

            "Chrysler Corp., capping the strongest annual sales performance in its history, said Tuesday it earned $807 million during the fourth quarter of 1996, with special charges holding it back from its best full-year profit ever.\n",
            "Detroit's No. 3 automaker reported full-year 1996 net income of $3.53 billion, or $4.77 per common share, compared with $2.025 billion, or $2.65 a share, for calendar-year 1995.\n",
            "Last year's results fell short of Chrysler's 1994 record of $3.71 billion because of $347 million in special charges.\n",
            "Chrysler said it finished 1996 with 2,450,826 U.S. retail vehicle sales, including fleet sales, which broke the 1988 calendar-year record of 2,208,057.\n",
            "\"One of the highlights of the year was the fact that according to independent data, Chrysler is the only auto manufacturer to beat industry average in both owner loyalty, or repurchase rate, and new customer conquest rate in 1996,\" Chrysler Chairman Robert J. Eaton said.\n",
            "\"That's the best way to grow the company and we did, increasing our combined U.S. and Canadian retail market share by 1.4 percentage points,\" he added.\n",
            "The fourth quarter's results, equal to $1.12 a share, compared with profits of $1.04 billion, or $1.35 a share, in the 1995 quarter. Revenues climbed to $16.2 billion from $15.1 billion.\n",
            "Chrysler's performance in the latest period included charges totalling $279 million related to the retirement of debt, the write-down of its investment in Pentastar Electronics, lump sum retiree pension costs and a voluntary early retirement programme.\n",
            "On an operating basis, both the fourth quarter and full year were records for Chrysler.\n",
            "Excluding the charges, Chrysler earned $1.09 billion in the quarter and $3.88 billion for the year, beating out its previous operating records of $1.04 billion in the fourth quarter of 1994 and $3.58 billion in the full 1994 year.\n",
            "Chrysler attributed its strong performance to a 10.7 percent increase in worldwide factory vehicle sales, to 2,958,800 from 2,673,539 in 1995.\n",
            "Based on strong sales of trucks, sport/utility vehicles and minivans, Chrysler's share of the U.S. and Canadian car and truck market climbed to 16.1 percent for the year from 14.7 percent in 1995.\n",
            "Eaton said, however, that the company will not rest on its laurels.\n",
            "\"There is no end to the improvements we can achieve if we remain vigilant about controlling our costs and about continually improving our processes and our products,\" he said in a statement accompanying the results.\n",
            "\"That's the challenge we're all focused on and it's one I'm confident we'll meet.\"\n",
            "Chrysler said its employees will share the wealth, with about 79,000 U.S. hourly and salaried workers receiving an average profit-sharing payment of $7,900 in February.\n",
            "That compares with $3,200 for the company's 1995 performance and $8,000 for the 1994 performance, which was received by about 75,200 employees.\n",
            "Chrysler's stock rose 62.5 cents to $35.125 in very early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\n",

            "Britain's largest life insurance group Prudential Corp said on Wednesday it is to increase its exposure to the top end of the personal financial services market by taking a near 30 percent stake in St James's Place Capital.\n",
            "The move coincides with news that St James' is seeking to buy the 49 percent of life insurer J. Rothschild Assurance (JRA) it does not already own and comes hot on the heels of the Pru's purchase of mutual insurer Scottish Amicable two weeks ago.\n",
            "It is the attraction of JRA, set up by St James's co-founder Sir Mark Weinberg in 1992, and its upmarket clientele which lies behind the Pru's interest in St James's.\n",
            "JRA targets high net-worth individuals, managing some 1.7 billion pounds ($2.8 billion) for its near 200,000 policyholders.\n",
            "In 1996, the company announced a 41 percent growth in new business, among the highest in the industry.\n",
            "Despite assurances from the Pru that it would respect JRA's wishes to stay independent, any future takeover of it or St.James would represent a neat hat-trick for Weinberg.\n",
            "In the 1960s he founded insurance firm Abbey Life, which he later sold to Lloyds Bank. He then set up Allied Dunbar, eventually selling that to B.A.T Industries.\n",
            "However, the Pru has agreed not to increase its holding in St James's for at least a year, unless the company attracts a bid from a third party.\n",
            "That undertaking was described as \"fundamental\" to the deal by Mike Wilson chief executive of JRA.\n",
            "The Pru will pay around 39.6 million pounds for 30.5 million St James's shares, to add to the 10.4 million shares it already owns.\n",
            "Scottish Amicable holds approximately 20 percent of JRA which after conversion into St James shares will give the Pru control of 118.8 million shares or 29.9 percent.\n",
            "\"Something had to happen to sort out the interest the Pru acquired through ScotAm. This looks an elegant intermediate step but may not be the final solution,\" said one industry analyst.\n",
            "The move gave the Pru strategic options, he said and a purchase of JRA further down the line would not conflict with its existing Prudential or Scottish Amicable brands.\n",
            "\"The value would be in keeping it separate. It's a fairly unique organisation and the Pru's chief executive Peter Davis has said in the past that there's nothing wrong with operating separate brands.\"\n",
            "St James said it believed the plans would enable JRA to achieve more rapid growth through improved incentives for the sales force and a simplification of the management structure.\n",
            "Plans to float JRA on the stock market, possibly as early as this summer, have been shelved.\n",
            "Wilson said today's proposals would result in the same benefits for shareholders but at an earlier stage than would otherwise have been possible.\n",
            "JRA contributed 11 million pounds towards St James' after tax profits from continuing operations of 25.1 million pounds in the nine months to December 31, 1996, up from 5.5 million pounds for the whole of the previous year.\n",
            "St James said it believed JRA, with its high quality, focused distribution and strong brand name was well placed to take advantage of current developments in the industry.\n",
            "Lord Rothschild who co-founded St James's with Weinberg, sold half his family's stake for 13.8 million pounds last October following his decision to step down as joint chairman after the group's reconstruction in the summer.\n",
            "St James's also owns Life Assurance Holding Corp which specialises in the acquisition and management of closed life assurance policies and Global Asset Management, a specialist fund management company. ($ = 0.615 British Pounds)\n",

            "Upmarket retailer David Jones Ltd reported on Wednesday a 50 percent fall in net profit for the 1996/97 first half and said it expected to make the appointment of its new chief executive officer (CEO) soon.\n",
            "David Jones, which is currently without a chief following the resignation of Chris Tideman on Monday, reported a net profit of A$22.34 million in the 26 weeks ended January 25, compared with a net profit of A$44.64 million a year ago.\n",
            "The retailer also said the 1996/97 year net profit would be lower than the previous year.  \n",
            "Chairman Richard Warburton said the retailer would also review five or six of its underperperforming stores, but would not say if that meant store closures, but added that David Jones was also committed to its store expansion programme.\n",
            "Tideman, who joined the company in 1994, made a surprise resignation on Monday, citing personal reasons.\n",
            "Responding to reports that there was shareholder pressure on Tideman to resign, Warburton said Tideman left of his own will and that there was no pressure from the board or shareholders.  \n",
            "Tideman oversaw the refloat of David Jones in November 1995 from the corporate remains of the debt-laden Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd, which cash-starved David Jones for most of the latter part of its 15-year ownership tenure.\n",
            "\"We expect to make an annoucement within days, not weeks,\" Warburton said about the chief executive appointment.\n",
            "Warburton said the half year results were helped by a good January, but described the result as \"disappointing.\"\n",
            "\"February saw a bit of a correction from the January upturn, but we have seen a slight increase in March,\" Warburton said.  \n",
            "\"Over the balance of the year, the company will continue to focus on implementing initiatives in product, consumer service and systems,\" the company said in the results statement.\n",
            "\"However, at this stage it is anticipated that the profit before tax level in the second half will be below the same period last year,\" the company said.\n",
            "David Jones warned in early January that its first half profit would be up to 50 percent below forecast due to a lacklustre retail trading environment.  \n",
            "Warburton said today the company did not expect any material improvement in retail trading conditions in the second half, adding that three reductions in official interest rates in 1996 had yet to filter through to the retailing sector.\n",
            "Finance director Robert Wright said today David Jones' 1996/97 profit would be within analysts forecasts of between A$32 million and A$37 million.\n",
            "David Jones sales fell one percent to A$782.58 million in the 1996/97 first half.  \n",
            "Warburton said the retailer would review about five or six of its 30 stores department stores which were underperforming and not returing any shareholder vale.\n",
            "He said about one-third of David Jones stores were performing very well, another third were making a profit, but could be improved, while the final third were underperforming and not returning any shareholder value.\n",
            "\"You have got a final third that's just not producing shareholder value. They are not necessarily losing money but they are not increasing shareholder value,\" he said.  \n",
            "\"Out of that third a half, I believe, with a bit of hard work and creative juices could take them above the line, the other half we have to look at very, very closely.\"\n",
            "\"So you can see we have about five or six stores to look at, that does not necessarily mean closure. It may mean you have to look at different things to do with those stores,\" he said.\n",
            "At 2.50 p.m. (0350 GMT), David Jones shares were two cents lower at A$1.72 with 487,292 shares traded.\n",

            "Boeing Co. stock surged Tuesday after the company decided to mothball plans to build a costly stretch version of its 747 jumbo jet.\n",
            "Boeing shares jumped $6.875 to a record $113.375 on the New York Stock Exchange, accounting for much of the rise in the Dow Jones industrial average. Boeing is one of 30 stocks in the index of blue-chip companies.\n",
            "Industry analysts estimated the move by the world's largest aircraft manufacturer, announced late on Monday, could reduce Boeing's expenses by more than $2 billion over the next five years and boost annual earnings by as much as $1 a share.\n",
            "NatWest Securities analyst Nick Heymann said the decision not to proceed with the risky project removed a cloud of uncertainty over Boeing as it boosts production to meet rising demand and prepares to complete its planned $14 billion purchase of McDonnell Douglas Corp.\n",
            "\"It's fantastic news,\" he said.\n",
            "While officials at Boeing rival Airbus Industrie said the European consortium would go ahead with plans for an all-new superjumbo jetliner called the A-3XX, Heymann said he thought that project was dead.\n",
            "\"Airbus never really had the resources to go ahead with their aircraft,\" Heymann said.\n",
            "He said it was even less likely the consortium could raise the funds now that Boeing had talked with the same potential customers and determined market conditions did not justify the investment needed for a new big jet.\n",
            "Boeing said it would cost more than $7 billion just to develop a new wing and make other changes needed to produce two new versions of the 747 that would add range and capacity.\n",
            "Analysts noted that the estimated cost of developing the so-called 747-500X and 747-600X had ballooned over the past two years from as little as $3 billion as prospective customers such as British Airways Plc and Singapore Airlines Ltd. demanded more features.\n",
            "In the end, only Thai Airways International Ltd. and Malaysian Airline System committed to ordering the proposed new jumbo.\n",
            "Boeing executives said the projected demand for fewer than 500 very large jets over the next 20 years was not enough to generate a sufficient shareholder return.\n",
            "\"Sufficient market demand has not yet developed to justify committing the significant investment required to develop larger versions of the 747,\" Ron Woodard, president of the Boeing commercial airplane group, said in a statement.\n",
            "While most of the 1,000 Boeing employees working on the 747-X project will be shifted to other planned derivatives, Woodard said Boeing would continue studying the possibility of a jet bigger than the current-generation 747-400.\n",
            "Airbus, which projects a far bigger market for jets that can seat more than 500 passengers, has said it can develop an all-new jet for $8 billion, but analysts peg the total cost at closer to a whopping $15 billion.\n",
            "Analysts said Airbus could develop an attractive airliner to alleviate congestion at the world's biggest airports and on heavily travelled routes, but they were sceptical about the consortium's ability to keep costs down.\n",
            "\"At the end of the day it's going to come down to the cost of building the airplane,\" said Byron Callan of Merrill Lynch. \"This only increases the pressure on Airbus to restructure and restructure quickly.\"\n",
            "He and other analysts said Airbus now might be more willing to take the risk needed to launch a new large jet to break Boeing's monopoly on the lucrative top end of the market.\n",
            "Citing increasing \"route fragmentation,\" especially across the Pacific Ocean, Boeing said it plans to focus its development efforts on new versions of the medium-sized 767 and 777 twin-engine models.\n",
            "Boeing already has begun offering an increased-capacity version of the 767 that could be launched with an initial order in the next few months.\n",
            "Boeing also is considering new versions of the 777 that would add both capacity and range.\n",

            "Another prominent defector, Li Il-nam, a nephew of North Korean leader Kim Jong-ils ex-wife, remained in a coma after being shot and critically wounded at the weekend by suspected North Korean agents near Seoul.\n",
            "Security around South Koreas ports, airports and other public places had been beefed up and 10,000 police and soldiers searched for the two suspected agents who shot Li.\n",
            "Seoul Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha said problems stemming from Hwangs defection were just the start of headaches for Seoul because of a crisis in the North.\n",

            "Dour warnings from North Korean officials in Beijing of the consequences of any attempt to move Hwang to the South gave a hint of Pyongyangs willingness to retaliate.\n",

            "Hada, 41, former manager of the Mongolian Academic Bookshop, and Tegexi, 30, who worked in the Inner Mongolian Bureau of Foreign Affairs, were sentenced last December to 15 and 10 years in prison respectively, Amnesty said.\n",
            "Chinese courts rejected their appeals last month and upheld their original sentences, it said. The pair had been held for a year in solitary confinement without charges or a trial.\n",
            "\"No evidence has been made public to show that Hada and Tegexi were involved in any activity which may be regarded as criminal under international standards,\" Amnesty said.\n",

            "The Amnesty report could not be independently confirmed. Officials in China could not be reached for comment on the eve of Lunar New Year holidays.\n",

            "Inner Mongolia, a Chinese province, is populated mainly by ethnic Mongolians but there has been little sign of anti-Chinese unrest since the early years after the 1949 communist takeover and the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution when dissent was crushed.\n",
            "However, in late 1995, authorities in Inner Mongolia arrested 12 people who had demanded more democracy and an autonomous region, according to human rights groups.\n",

            "Ford Motor Co. halted light truck assembly lines at three plants Friday as planned because of a strike at a seat supplier, but signed up another company to help it clear out the backlog of 7,700 Expeditions built without proper seats.\n",
            "Following an appeal from Ford Chairman Alex Trotman, Lear Corp. Chairman Kenneth Way agreed to have his company make seats for Ford's Expedition full-size sport utility vehicle once the walkout is settled, according to sources in the supply industry.\n",
            "Under the arrangement, Lear, which already is a large Ford supplier, would make second and third row seats for the Expedition, said Donna Parolini, president of International Business Development Corp., a consulting firm in Troy, Mich.\n",
            "Front seats for the vehicles are being made by Ford's Chesterfield, Mich., trim plant, Ford officials have said. Ford spokesman Bert Serre said the plant has been making a limited number of seats, less than 20 an hour.\n",
            "Ford suspended all production at its Michigan Assembly in Wayne, which makes the Expedition and F-Series pickup trucks, after the United Auto Workers and Johnson Controls Inc. failed to settle a strike, which entered its 11th day Friday.\n",
            "Ohio plants affected were the Econoline and Club Wagon full-size van assembly line in Lorain and a frame production line at Ohio Assembly in Avon Lake. About 6,800 workers were idled as a result of the action.\n",
            "Industry analysts said the strike has Ford in a huge bind. The Expedition is one of its most profitable and popular vehicles, earning Ford an estimated pre-tax profit of $10,000 each. Under normal production, it makes 840 vehicles at day Michigan Truck, the only plant where the Expedition is made.\n",
            "But to avoid angering its own UAW workers, Ford refused to accept seats made by non-union replacement workers. It had been making the vehicles with temporary seats. But after making about 14,800 Expeditions and Econolines without proper seats, Ford decided to shut production down completely.\n",
            "\"To interrupt Expedition production for any extended period of time would hurt Ford financially in North America,\" said Michael Robinet, managing director of CSM Forecasting in Farmington Hills, Mich.\n",
            "Because Ford and Lear do not want to provoke the UAW, Lear, which has unionized plants, would not start producing seats until the strike is over, said Parolini. Another issue prohibiting Lear from making seats immediately is the fact that it buys seat frames from the same Johnson Controls facility that assembles seats for Ford.\n",
            "Shutting down Expedition production means an extension of the three- to six-month wait that many consumers already face. Introduced last fall, the Expedition has been a huge hit with buyers looking for a sleek, larger sport utility.\n",
            "\"The reception of this vehicle has been the highest of anything I've seen since the original Mustang,\" said Lou Stanford, owner of Varsity Ford in Ann Arbor, Mich., one of the largest Ford dealers in the country.\n",

            "A South Korean official on Tuesday said progress had been made in talks with China over the fate of the most senior leader to flee Pyongyang but terms of his departure from Beijing were still undecided.\n",
            "Hwang Jang-yop, a senior North Korean ideologue and top aide to supreme leader Kim Jong-il, has been stranded in Seoul's mission in Beijing since February 12 while the three nations negotiate his fate.\n",
            "\"There has been some headway. Negotiations are still going on,\" said Chang Moon-ik, spokesman for the South Korean embassy in Beijing.\n",

            "\"Final arrangements have yet to be done first. There has been no final decision,\" Chang said by telephone.\n",
            "Weeks of talks over Hwang's fate, interrupted by the death of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping last month, have failed to produce an accord as Beijing finds itself torn between an old communist ally and a new capitalist friend.\n",
            "\"We want to bring Mr Hwang to Seoul directly but if that is not possible we can make other arrangements,\" Chang said. Korean sources have said Hwang may be whisked away to another country, possibly in Southeast Asia.\n",

            "His defection has placed extra strains on ties between the two Koreas, arch-enemies since the 1950-53 civil war ended in an uneasy ceasefire.\n",
            "Armed Chinese police backed by armoured personnel carriers and a crowd control truck maintained a tight security cordon around Seoul's consular compound where Hwang is holed up in Beijing's normally sedate diplomatic quarter.\n",
            "Beijing has appealed to North and South Korea to stay calm during attempts to end the diplomatic standoff sparked by Hwang's defection.\n",
            "Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said last week Beijing was still investigating Hwang's case and hoped for a solution as soon as possible.\n",
            "North Korea initially accused the South of kidnapping Hwang, then changed its hardline stance by saying if he really had defected he was a traitor and would be dismissed.\n",

            "Any sweeping settlement among state governments and tobacco companies would leave standing a great many anti-smoking suits, including a $5 billion claim scheduled for a June 2 trial, plaintiff lawyers said on Friday.\n",
            "\"It's a lousy settlement for my clients and the American people,\" said Stanley Rosenblatt, one of two lawyers pressing the Broin class-action suit here on behalf of flight attendants claiming injuries from secondhand tobacco smoke.  \n",
            "Rosenblatt's case goes to trial on June 2 and is a landmark, because it is both the first class-action suit against cigarette makers to survive preliminary legal challenges and the first trial of a claim of damage from second-hand smoke.\n",

            "According to published reports, in part challenged by Mississippi Attorney General Michael Moore, tobacco companies and the 29 state governments suing the industry for billions in healthcare spending on smokers are near a deal limiting the number and type of lawsuits which could be brought by smokers.  \n",
            "The Wall Street Journal said the proposed terms would make it nearly impossible for future smokers to sue cigarette makers for lung cancer and other common tobacco-related illnesses. \"The global settlement is not a done deal,\" said Stieger. \"There is not a whole lot of support for a deal messing with the tort system.\"\n",

            "Barclays shares were down 55-1/2 pence at 1144p in afternoon trade, having hit a low of 1131p, after the news that pretax profits at the bank rose by 13 percent to 2.36 billion pounds ($3.8 billion), including an exceptional 70 million pounds gain on disposals.\n",
            "The shares took a further tumble as analysts returning from meeting the company moved to downgrade the stock. Analysts at SBC Warburg cut the stock to \"hold\" from \"buy\", market sources said, and others were cautious on the outlook for the share.\n",
            "The profits were at the lower end of forecasts and included a 29 percent fall in operating profits at BZW to 204 million pounds.\n",
            "The company, which has repurchased over one billion pounds of shares in the last 18 months, said it would return 500 million pounds to shareholders in the next twelve months, and raised its dividend by 21 percent to 31.5 pence, in line with forecasts.\n",
            "But even the buy-back news failed to cheer the market.\n",
            "\"The basic message is that there was disappointment about the headline profits and dividend, the mix of profits and the potential size of any buyback,\" said Michael Lever, analyst at HSBC James Capel.\n",

            "Barclays chief executive Martin Taylor mounted a spirited defence of the results and his strategy at BZW, saying that the UK banking figures were \"cracking\" and that Barclays was investing for the future at BZW.\n",
            "\"You have to be careful not to be frightened by your own shadow,\" Taylor told Reuters in an interview. \"The reason that the returns are depressed (at BZW) this year is that we're spending so much.\"\n",
            "BZW chief executive Bill Harrison said he plans to improve links between BZW's key areas to build profitable business. He added that the bank's markets division had needed a \"significant upgrade\", but had now been \"re-tooled...and is strongly placed to make a significant earnings contribution.\"\n",
            "In a statement earlier, Barclays admitted underperformance by BZW in the fixed income market, with the exception of sterling, and foreign exchange area.\n",

            "BZW has had had a turbulent time in the past year which started with the death of its chief executive David Band and has included high-level management shake-ups.\n",
            "On top of this, BZW has also been involved in what have been perceived as some high-profile disasters with its clients. The biggest of these was its takeover defence for Northern Electric against U.S. energy group CE Electric which is being investigated by Britain's Takeover Panel. The late disclosure by BZW of a 250,000 sterling discretionary fee clause meant that CE's offer was extended and it captured Northern by the slimmest of margins.\n",
            "But Taylor said that well-publicised events last year such as the Northern Electric defence had not done BZW damage.\n",
            "\"I think Northern Electric showed BZW behaving very energetically to try and prevent a client being taken over and almost succeeding,\" Taylor said. \"We very nearly saved it.\"\n",

            "He noted that earnings per share had risen by 25 percent to 104.2p per share.\n",
            "Taylor also rejected the notion that Barclays was devoid of ideas because it wanted to return capital.\n",

            "CSX Chairman John Snow described Norfolk Southern's effort as a \"desperate act\" that may be confusing shareholders.\n",
            "\"They had suffered two stinging defeats. They were probably reeling and felt the need to do something,\" Snow said in a telephone interview.\n",
            "He was referring to setbacks last week in which a federal judge and a regulatory agency denied Norfolk Southern's attempt to block the Conrail-CSX transaction.\n",
            "Norfolk, Va.-based Norfolk Southern, whose $10.3 billion bid for Conrail has been rejected, said late Monday it would buy 9.9 percent of Conrail stock if the Philadelphia-based railroad's shareholders defeated a key measure that would allow the proposed Conrail-CSX transaction to proceed.\n",
            "Wall Street sources had speculated the new development in the three-month takeover battle could prompt Conrail to delay the shareholder meeting.\n",
            "Conrail will be asking shareholders to waive a Pennsylvania law that would essentially require Richmond, Va.-based CSX to pay for Conrail in cash. The proposed Conrail-CSX transaction is a mixture of cash and stock.\n",
            "Norfolk Southern has offered to buy Conrail for cash.\n",
            "Snow said he was \"reasonably confident, but guarded\" Conrail shareholders would approve the measure Friday.\n",

            "Wall Street analysts said Norfolk Southern might win some new allies with its plans, but said its efforts to derail the merger may not succeed.\n",
            "\"It might have some influence on (the shareholders), but it looks to me like it may be too late.

            "\"If we lose it, I think it's going to be 'shame on us' for not having communicated fully the benefits of this merger,\" Snow said. \"What I propose doing, if we lost it ... would be to take our time, and patiently go around and talk to the shareholders -- that may take three months, that may take six months -- until they really understood the merger.\"\n",

            "Using cost cuts to offset flat same-store sales, discount retail giant Kmart Corp. Wednesday reported a $9 million third-quarter profit, compared with a year-ago loss of $69 million.\n",
            "The results, equal to 2 cents a share, slightly exceeded Wall Street analysts' consensus expectation that the Troy, Mich.-based retailer would break even during the August-October period.\n",
            "Nevertheless, Kmart stock closed down 62.5 cents at $10.50 on the New York Stock Exchange after Chairman Floyd Hall dismissed rumours that Kmart was the target of a possible takeover by leveraged buyout specialists Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.\n",
            "The rumours drove Kmart's stock up $1.625 on Tuesday.\n",
            "Speaking to reporters at the opening of Kmart's second Manhattan store, Hall said he has not heard from KKR.\n",
            "\"As far as we know, they are all rumours,\" he said.\n",
            "In a statement accompanying the third-quarter results, Hall said Kmart is \"beginning to see meaningful progress toward a recovery.\"\n",
            "\"Our biggest challenge of the year lies just ahead in the fourth quarter, and we remain cautiously optimistic about our near-term outlook,\" he added.\n",
            "But sales growth has been a tough challenge since Hall was hired to rebuild Kmart in June 1995.\n",
            "Kmart's total revenues for the quarter fell 1.6 percent from last year to $7.85 billion. Company-wide same-store sales rose 0.1 percent from a year ago and same-store sales for U.S. Kmart stores increased 0.8 percent.\n",
            "Hall said revenues did not meet the company's growth expectations for the period, but savings from store closings, contracting out of certain functions and other costs cuts have resulted in a $370 million reduction in Kmart's year-to-date selling, general and administrative expenses.\n",
            "But Kmart's gross margin rate for the third quarter increased to 22.6 percent of sales from 21.2 percent last year, reflecting fewer markdowns to clear aged inventory and a lower level of overall promotional activity, Kmart said.\n",
            "Analysts said the slow sales growth suggests that Kmart is still losing market share to archrivals Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target, a unit of Dayton Hudson Corp. But they were pleased with Kmart's 8 percent reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses for the period.\n",
            "\"If you compare it with last year, the company is making considerable progress. The part of the equation that remains is to get the sales up,\" said Brown Brothers Harriman analyst Joseph Ronning.\n",
            "Kmart executives told analysts in a conference call that they expect better sales results in the near future from their apparel offerings -- particularly children's clothing -- and the \"pantry concept\" stores, which offer several aisles of attractively priced consumable items such as soft drinks and snacks just inside the front entrance.\n",
            "Kmart now has about 180 pantry concept stores in the United States and will change 450 stores to the new format annually for the next couple of years.\n",
            "Hall also told reporters that Kmart is aiming for a 3.5 percent to 5 percent increase in same-store sales for the all-important holiday selling period. Kmart could achieve a 6-7 percent increase, Hall said. But he cautioned that he didn't want to sacrifice profit margins to achieve that figure.\n",
            "Still, he said analysts' estimates that Kmart will earn a profit of $165.5 million for the fourth quarter ending in January 1997 were \"reasonable.\"\n",
            "Kmart, the second largest retailer in the United States, operates 2,143 Kmart and 168 Builders Square retail outlets, and operates 129 stores internationally.\n",

            "The high waters caused about 80 million yuan ($9.6 million) in damage and forced the closure of a zinc oxide production line for three months, Jiang told Reuters in an interview.\n",
            "Damage from the floods has since been repaired and 1997 output will rise above last year's, he said.\n",

            "Profits were just half of those in 1995, Jiang said, but forecast they would rise to about 21 million yuan this year.\n",

            "The smelter's output of zinc alloys would hit 1,900 tonnes in 1997, output of zinc sulphate 3,800 tonnes and that of zinc powder about 1,700 tonnes, he said.\n",
            "Production of lithopone, used in low-grade paints, would reach 28,500 tonnes but domestic demand was expected to slump as rising living standards fuelled the market for higher quality paints, he said.\n",

            "Jiang gave a lukewarm welcome to a recent central government decision to cut zinc export tariffs in 1997.\n",
            "Beijing's move to lower the temporary export tariff on zinc to zero in 1997 from 5.0 percent last year would have little effect on the plant's exports due to government quotas on the metal, Jiang said.\n",
            "\"Our exports won't be more than 20 percent of our output this year,\" he said.\n",
            "That compared to exports of 45 percent of production in 1993, he said.\n",

            "Asked if Optus Communications would postpone its float beyond this year, Switkowski said: \"No, not at all. The float is clearly held up by the process of the litigation. Once the litigation is resolved, the board will meet and make decisions about how the float should proceed.\n",
            "\"The timetable for this year is still very much our desire,\" Switkowski said.\n",

            "Speaking at Prague's Zofin Forum of business leaders Klaus said there was no way to slow inflation quickly, and that central bank steps last year to rein in consumer prices were more than the government wanted.\n",
            "\"At this moment I see in the Czech economy the existence of an array of short-term irremovable inflation factors which we cannot simply get rid of, and I also do not see any easy way to a faster slowing of inflation,\" said Klaus, a monetarist professor of economics.\n",
            "Klaus took issue with restrictive monetary measures of the Czech National Bank last year which helped cut inflation to 7.3 percent year-on-year in February from levels above nine percent in the previous year.\n",
            "He said that the government differed with the central bank on whether monetary tightening measures to slow inflation would slow the economy.\n",
            "\"I believe that in our context and in our structural parameters disinflation bought at the high price of a marked loss in the pace of economic growth was more than we would have wished,\" he added.\n",

            "He said that 1996 full-year gross domestic product growth ended one percent lower than the government originally expected. He did not give a specific result. The government's original forecast was growth of 4.8 percent.\n",
            "Full-year official GDP results are expected later this month.\n",
            "Klaus said factors in this slowing of growth were weak demand for exports because of weak growth and protected markets in western Europe. Another reason was the \"unfavourable structure of our domestic demand -- consumer as well as investment.\"\n",
            "Klaus however stressed the \"restrictive measures of the central bank\" and its role on demand as a factor and said the CNB \"used\" the chaos after inconclusive June elections to raise interest rates and tighten minimum reserve requirements.\n",

            "Vyborny said a commission set up to evaluate binds in the latest tender had actually put Unisys narrowly ahead of EDS-Digital. But the ministry had decided to ignore its recommendation due to the consortium's lower price and greater experience, he told an news conference.\n",

            "However, they said hopes for a deal were high, with Hayes and her team believed to be putting the finishing touches to the text of an agreement.\n",
            "\"I expect the reason for the talks not wrapping up is market access,\" said National Retail Federation vice-president Robert P. Hall said on Friday. \"This is an issue that is not traditionally part of apparel bilaterals.\"\n",

            "The French government is moving edgily towards a key decision for the future of Europe's defence industry -- whether to privatise defence electronics group Thomson-CSF through a public sale or private placement.\n",
            "The stakes are huge, as the choice of the method of sale will to a large extent determine the final outcome of a far-reaching restructuring in the French defence industry and has major implications for the entire sector in Europe.\n",
            "Like a master chess player, the state must look several moves ahead, decide what sort of defence industry it wants to see in a few years' time, and ensure the decision will be seen as fair to all involved.\n",
            "Government sources said on Friday that the decision, originally expected at the end of January, would probably slip into early February because the government was studying in great detail all the elements of the politically-sensitive dossier that involves Europe's biggest defence electronics company.\n",
            "\"The decision will be taken shortly, but not today. We are still studying all possibilities,\" said an official source.\n",
            "\"The decision will have to be taken by the cabinet. At the moment there is no proposal to send to the ministers. I could not tell you when exactly that will happen,\" he added.\n",
            "Prime Minister Alain Juppe is anxious to avoid another embarassment like the one he suffered on December 4 when the government had to suspend an earlier privatisation plan under which Thomson-CSF would have gone to conglomerate Lagardere Groupe.\n",
            "That deal involved the privatisation of the Thomson group, which included both a 68 percent stake in Thomson-CSF and 100 percent of consumer electronics group Thomson Multimedia (TMM).\n",
            "The state was forced to call off the plan because the independent privatisation commission balked at the terms of a sale of TMM to South Korea's Daewoo Electronics.\n",
            "The cancellation outraged the Korean, who called the decision racist and prompted an angry call for explanation from President Kim Young-sam.\n",
            "Since then the French government has decided to separate the sales of TMM and Thomson-CSF.\n",
            "The ultimate aim of the government is to have a strong defence industry able to supply its armed forces with state-of-the art weaponry and play a leading role in Europe and on the world scene.\n",
            "A year ago, President Jacques Chirac announced a wide-ranging restructuring of the French defence industry around a merged group of Aerospatiale and Dassault Aviation for aerospace, and Thomson-CSF for electronics.\n",
            "In France alone, any such restructuring would affect the business of Lagardere, owner of Matra Espace Defense with British Aerospace Plc as a partner, Alcatel Alsthom and its ally GEC Plc, and smaller groups such as Sagem and Compagnie des Signaux.\n",

            "This would leave the government with the biggest influence on the outcome, but also with the biggest responsibilty.\n",
            "Another procedure, rare in France, would be to auction the state's 68-percent stake in Thomson-CSF among qualified bidders, putting the emphasis on price and ensuring the greatest possible revenues for the state at a time France is trying to reduce its public deficits ahead of monetary union.\n",

            "Diplomats in the capital also said the 459-member group would draw a veil over the Communist Party's internal politics ahead of a key party congress where decisions on top jobs and future policies would be made later this year.\n",
            "\"This is obviously too big a group to make funeral arrangements,\" said a Western diplomat on Friday. \"Not everyone will be making decisions.\"\n",
            "Deng died on Wednesday aged 92. China will hold the funeral for its paramount leader next Tuesday in the cavernous Great Hall of the People in Beijing.\n",
            "The ceremonies -- unlike those for revolutionary leader Mao Zedong in 1976 -- will not include a lying in state with a mourning public allowed to file past.\n",
            "In accordance with his wishes, Deng's body parts will be donated to science and his ashes will be scattered at sea.\n",
            "Deng's anointed successor, Commmunist Party chief and state President Jiang Zemin, is chairman of the funeral committee that includes all members of the 18-man Politburo and veterans of the communist revolution such as former president Yang Shangkun, 89, and ex-parliament chairman Peng Zhen, 95.\n",
            "The list also includes Hua Guofeng, Mao's chosen successor until he was toppled by Deng.\n",
            "\"It is meant to be a sign of great unity and stability,\" said another foreign envoy.\n",
            "Diplomats said the inclusion of the elder statesmen in the group aimed to lend legitimacy to the current leadership, providing a link to the party's revolutionary roots.\n",
            "\"This gives them some continuity with the first generation of the leadership,\" said a European diplomat.\n",
            "But it also helps conceal the inner workings of the party as key figures jockey for position before the 15th party congress.\n",
            "Broad decisions on political and economic strategy are likely to be taken at the meeting, held every five years.\n",
            "Political analysts said the creation of a smaller group to direct the funeral arrangements might give too much information to the public which is normally kept at a safe distance from the party's internal workings.\n",
            "The tighter the group, the easier to identify the main players, they said.\n",
            "\"They (party leaders) don't want to reveal too much before the congress,\" said the European diplomat.\n",

            "CE Electric claimed 50.03 percent of British target Northern Electric in a fiercely fought bid on Saturday but, in an unusual twist, needs takeover panel approval on crucial extra acceptances to declare victory.\n",
            "A spokesman for the U.S. company said additional acceptances were still being counted. CE Electric held 49.77 percent of the regional electricity company (Rec) by its own 1300 GMT deadline on December 20, just short of control, but in an unprecedented move the British takeover panel stepped in to extend final deadlines.  \n",
            "The panel said late on Friday that the deadline for the 782 million pound ($1.30 billion) contentious offer had been extended to 1300 GMT on Christmas Eve and said any acceptances arriving after CE's Friday deadline must have its consent.\n",
            "No one at the takeover panel was immediately available for comment, nor was Northern Electric.\n",
            "The Financial Times newspaper said on Saturday that the extension of the deadlines suggested the panel felt shareholders had not been treated fairly in the last days of the 650 pence per share bid.\n",
            "CE Electric said in a statement earlier on Saturday that the panel had \"prohibited Northern's advisers from purchasing Northern Electric shares at anytime prior to the close of CE Electric's final offers.\"\n",
            "The American energy group had complained to the takeover panel earlier this week over share buying by Northern's advisers, brokers BZW and Schroders, which it claimed was \"frustrating action\".\n",
            "But the panel cleared the purchases, which amounted to 2.32 percent of Northern, late on Thursday.\n",
            "It said in a statement then that at a hearing of the panel BZW and Schroders had \"accepted that there was no doubt about their intention -- it was to defeat the bid. However, they denied that there had been any breach of the code.\"\n",
            "The panel said such purchases have \"long been accepted.\"\n",
            "The bid, which was raised from an original 630 pence per share offer on December 6, has been hotly contested by Northern, which claims the price undervalues it.\n",
            "Northern had claimed it had the backing of its largest institutional investor, the Prudential, which holds around 11 percent, as well as other funds including M&amp;G and Foreign &amp; Colonial.\n",
            "But prior to Friday's deadline, CE Electric already held 30 percent of Northern, bought on the open market, and had previously declared acceptances which brought its holding up to around 34 percent.\n",
            "Northern is the only one of the original 12 cash-rich Recs to have successfully fought off a takeover bid, spending 560 million pounds on shareholder benefits to fend off Trafalgar House, now part of Norway's Kvaerner, last year.\n",
            "Nine of the 12 Recs have been sold or agreed to takeovers since they came up for grabs when the government's protective golden share expired in March 1995, just five years after privatisation.\n",
            "If CE Electric wins control of Northern, only two of the original 12 Recs will remain independent -- Yorkshire and Southern.\n",
            "Analysts see Yorkshire, which could carry a price tag of around 1.4 billion pounds, as the more vulnerable of the two, as Southern could cost a predator over two billion pounds and has firepower to mount a fierce defence.\n",
            "American companies already own three Recs with two others in agreed takeovers, Dominion Resources with East Midlands and Entergy with London Electricity.\n",
            "U.S. companies are hotly tipped as potential buyers for remaining Recs as they are attracted to the UK's friendly regulatory environment and see the country as a good English-speaking springboard into continental Europe.\n",

            "No date has been set for the talks called by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. The talks would be the first formal negotiations since November 1995, when a tentative agreement, subsequently rejected, was submitted to UAW members.\n",
            "The 17-month strike ended in December 1995 without a new contract. Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar's workers have been without a contract since 1991.\n",

            "(Corrects by deleting the fourth paragraph, so that the story will reflect that at no point did Giering blame AT&amp;T for tax issues that NCR faces as an independent company.)\n",
            "NCR Corp eked out a small profit in the fourth quarter of 1996 and saw healthy gains in year-over-year profit margins but hopes of matching computer industry growth rates remain a long way off, executives said.\n",
            "In a conference call with analysts and a phone interview after the call, NCR Chief Financial Officer John Giering said profits are weighed down by a whopping 75 percent tax rate.\n",
            "Giering said NCR was unlikely to bring its tax levels down to resemble industry norms of 35 to 40 percent before 1999. \n",
            "He said his goal was to bring the company's U.S. operations to breakeven in 1997 in terms of profitablity. NCR is already profitable in its overseas operations, which accounted for half of its $7 billion in 1996 revenues.\n",
            "Besides slashing the company's tax rate, the NCR executive said the company's primary goal was to see a 9 to 12 percent growth rate from core operations over the next several years.\n",
            "Giering said he expected NCR to reach gross profit margins in the mid-30 percent range within three years.  \n",
            "In 1996 results released earlier Tuesday, gross margins for the year rose to 28.1 percent from 1995's 21.8 percent.\n",
            "Giering said profits remain small but tax liabilities are very large, hence the high effective rate. AT&amp;T absorbed much of the potential benefit from operating loss carry-forwards when NCR was still a subsidiary, he said.\n",
            "On balance, AT&amp;T relieved NCR of more than $3 billion in net losses since 1993, leaving NCR's balance sheet remarkably clean prior to its spin-off as a separate company this month.\n",
            "NCR said it ended 1996 with $1.2 billion in cash and debt of only $76 billion.  \n",
            "\"Right now (the tax rate) is in the 75 percent range,\" Giering told Reuters, \"I look at this as a 1997 phenonmon.\"\n",
            "He estimated that the tax rate would come down to roughly 50 percent in 1998 on the way to the 35 to 40 percent level expected in 1999. \"Clearly we need to have more income in the U.S. to turn that number around,\" Giering said.\n",
            "The company may be aided in its goal of balancing the contribution of its U.S. and international operations by trends in top-line revenue growth.  \n",
            "Giering told analysts that the 1996 revenues for core businesses, excluding mass-market PCs and the entry level server businesses it is exiting, grew 9 percent in the Americas, but declined one percent in Europe and 3 percent in the Asia/Pacific region.\n",
            "NCR does not break out its revenues in dollar terms.\n",
            "The CFO said his primary goals was to ensure that \"international operations are really paying their full share in terms of all the costs incurred on their on behalf.\"  \n",
            "He said one of the anomalies NCR is working hard to reconcile is that many of its corporate functions are domiciled in the United States, which made sense as a unit of AT&amp;T but now hurts NCR as a standalone entity at tax-time.\n",
            "Deep concern about NCR's financial prospects commbined with the company's insecure position in a computer industry that refuses to stand still has lead Wall Street analysts to be deeply leery of the stock since its public debut.\n",
            "Of the two analysts following the stock, one of them, Smith Barney's Shao Wang maintains a neutral rating. In an an unusual move on a neutral rated stock, Wang set a target price of $28 on the stock, well below its current price of $38-3/4.\n",
            "Nonetheless, on the strength of its ongoing turnaround, its limited fourth quarter profits and rising profit margins, NCR stock gained 3-1/8 on Tuesday.\n",

            "French conglomerate Generale des Eaux looks set to extend its power in the media after revealing on Monday it was in talks with Havas primarily about pay-television firm Canal Plus.\n",
            "\"Havas and Compagnie Generale des Eaux confirm discussions are now in progress concerning their respective interests in audiovisual activities, primarily Canal Plus,\" said a joint statement from Generale des Eaux and Havas.\n",
            "The announcement, rushed out before the stock exchange opened, followed press reports that the companies were preparing a deal which would make Generale des Eaux the key shareholder in Havas. That, in turn, would make the Havas media group the biggest shareholder in Canal Plus.\n",
            "The companies added that they would not comment further pending board meetings scheduled for February 6.\n",
            "The prospect of a major transformation of the French media landscape gained weight when a corporate source confirmed that Alcatel Alsthom was in talks about a possible sale of part of its 21.2 percent stake in Havas to Generale des Eaux.\n",
            "Generale des Eaux, already a powerful force in the water and telecommmunications industry, owns almost 20 percent of Canal Plus. The satellite broadcaster is itself merging with fellow-pay-TV group Nethold to create Europe's largest subscription television company.\n",
            "\"The big winner is (Generale des Eaux chairman) Jean-marie Messier who will find himself at the top of a pyramid in the French audiovisual sector,\" said an analyst at Paribas.\n",
            "According to French newspapers, Generale des Eaux would transfer its Canal Plus stake to Havas, almost doubling Havas's current 21.6 percent stake in the broadcaster. Havas would then increase its own capital to allow Generale des Eaux a bigger stake.\n",
            "Other major shareholders in Canal Plus are the bank Societe Generale with 4.5 percent, and the state-owned bank Caisse des Depots et Consignations with 6.9 percent.\n",
            "Generale des Eaux would also become indirectly the biggest shareholder in the merged Canal Plus company. Havas would establish its direct dominance within Canal Plus, well ahead of Nethold's owners, Richemont and MIH, which have 15 and 4.9 percent repectively.\n",
            "Alcatel has owned 21.2 percent of Havas since selling its media business to Havas in 1995 in return for shares in Havas, which it was obliged to hold on to for at least two years.\n",
            "The initial market reaction was broadly positive. Havas shares soared and those of Generale jumped too. \"It's a good deal for all parties involved,\" one share dealer said.\n",
            "Alcatel stands to make a capital gain on the sale, as well as receiving cash, because the Havas share price has risen strongly over the past year in line with a French stock market which is at record highs.\n",
            "Alcatel needs money to finance its planned acquisition, if the state permits it, of the government's 58 percent stake in defence electronics group Thomson-CSF.\n",
            "The government is due to announce its Thomson-CSF sale plans shortly, after scrapping its original privatisation plan in December.\n",
            "Newspapers have for months speculated about the Havas share structure, although Generale des Eaux has in the past denied plans to raise its stake.\n",
            "On the share market, Havas shares opened eight percent higher but then gave up some of the gains to close 4.56 percent up at 424 francs.\n",
            "Generale des Eaux was 1.55 percent up at 719, but Canal Plus was 0.42 percent lower at 1,177 and Alcatel slipped 1.09 percent to 542 francs.\n",

            "Chrysler, which is cautiously trying to rebuild its international presence, said the projects in Brazil were worth about $315 million, and the expansion in Argentina was worth about $65 million.\n",
            "Roughly one third of the total investment, or about $126.6 million, will come from Chrysler's suppliers, who will play a major role in the automaker's low-risk global growth strategy, Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton said.\n",
            "\"We don't intend to make risky investments just to be a major player in emerging markets,\" added Thomas Gale, Chrysler's executive vice president of international operations. \"We're quite content to grow at a steady pace in regions where we see solid opportunities.\"\n",
            "Eaton said the investments will boost Chrysler's sales in the Mercosur free-trade zone, which groups Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.\n",
            "But the company's limited production capacity will allow it only to grab a small portion of the Mercosur market away from rivals General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG, he said.\n",
            "\"We are targeting very specific market segments,\" he said. \"We don't have any interest or desire to offer a vehicle for every possible application.\"\n",
            "The new Brazilian plant, which will be Chrysler's third limited-production facility in South America, will assemble the automaker's all-new Dakota compact pickup truck for sale in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, the countries in the Mercosur free-trade zone.\n",
            "In Argentina, Chrysler said it will add production of about 6,000 Jeep Cherokees a year at a plant now under construction in the Cordoba province. The plant is already scheduled to build about 14,000 Jeep Grand Cherokees per year starting next April, and Cherokee output will begin in 1998.\n",
            "A site for the Brazilian plant will be selected by year-end and vehicles will roll off the assembly line starting in mid-1998, Chrysler said. Production, however, will be modest, with 12,000 trucks in the first year and an ultimate capacity of 40,000 units annually. Employment will start at 400 people.\n",
            "The trucks at first will be largely assembled from \"complete knock-down\" kits shipped from the United States, but the automaker intends to meet the Mercosur trade bloc's 60 percent local content requirement after three years.\n",
            "Chrysler has not decided whether to market the Dakota under the Dodge brand name or under one of its other brands. The automaker now uses the only Jeep and Chrysler brand names outside the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n",
            "The $315 million Brazil investment also includes a new diesel engine plant to be built by Detroit Diesel Corp..\n",
            "The $10 million facility will supply the company's Italian-designed VM Motori four-cylinder turbocharged diesel engines for use in the Brazilian Dakota as well as in Jeep models built in Argentina. Chrysler installs about 40,000 of the engines annually into minivans and Jeep Grand Cherokees sold in Europe.\n",
            "Others suppliers supporting the Chrysler by opening plants in Latin America include Dana Corp., Johnson Controls Inc., Lear Corp., Lear Corp. United Technologies Corp. and PPG Industries Inc., Chrysler executives said.\n",

            "Including a small plant in Venezuela that assembles Cherokees and Neon small cars from kits, the investments announced Tuesday bring to $735 million the total financial commitments Chrysler and its suppliers have made in South America, the company said.\n",

            "Russian Norilsk Nickel's poor 1996 financial results have tarnished plans to issue corporate paper for trading overseas, but the key metal producer has profitable, stable output and may be crying wolf, analysts said on Monday.\n",
            "\"We don't think the (financial) figures will affect output,\" said Dmitry Chernak, metals analyst at ING-Barings in Moscow.\n",
            "He said Norilsk -- one of the world's top producers of nickel and platinum group metals -- might be fudging the figures to attract government attention to its crippling social costs.\n",
            "Company officials and analysts said Norilsk's 1996 consolidated loss of 3.29 trillion roubles ($572 million), which RAO Norilsky Nikel reported last Friday, did not mean the Arctic industrial behemoth had no cash to finance output.\n",
            "\"There is and will be absolutely no effect on production or exports,\" said Alexei Parshikov, director of Interrosimpex, which handles some of the Norilsk group's exports.\n",
            "He said wage arrears to workers were down to less than two months and workers had no inclination to strike as they did earlier this spring before a deal with management was reached.\n",
            "But Norilsk spokesman Sergei Vetchinin said the company's financial picture was nonetheless unattractive.\n",
            "\"It's a paradox -- the production of metals is profitable, but then the profits get spent on social costs, which in theory the state, not we, should be supporting,\" he said, adding that Norilsk made money on output but subsidiary costs sucked up over 40 percent of annual revenues.\n",
            "The London Metal Exchange was closed on Monday for a bank holiday and most traders there were not available for comment.\n",
            "Norilsk is the world's second largest producer of nickel, a key component of stainless steel. It is the world's largest producer of palladium and one of the world's top three producers of platinum -- used in catalytic converters and jewellery.\n",
            "Chernak said Norilsk had better operating margins than its Western competitors but that rising output costs at the company would take their toll on 1996 margins.\n",
            "He said Norilsk's 1995 gross operating margin for nickel output was a robust 36 percent, and 34.8 percent for copper, compared with a Western metals industry average of 31.7 percent.\n",
            "Chernak said higher input costs would reduce Norilsk's margin to 23.0 percent for 1996, but he expected its 1996 net loss to ring in at $120 million equivalent -- far below the figures Norilsk announced.\n",
            "Norilsk's Vetchinin said the reported 1996 loss figure was calculated on an accruals basis, which meant it was not distorted by figures reflecting non-payment for goods or services, a problem plaguing Russian industrial companies and distorting balance sheets.\n",
            "But Chernak said Norilsk's loss was misleadingly bloated because it included, among other things, allocations to capital expenditure funds.\n",
            "A senior Norilsk official told Reuters the 1996 loss meant plans to issue American Depositary Receipts -- paper allowing shares in foreign companies to be traded on world exchanges and avoiding settlement hassles -- were on the backburner.\n",
            "\"That such a possibility (postponing the issue) is being examined is unquestionable,\" said Yuri Kaluzhsky, Norilsk's head for projects and corporate finance, who had told Reuters one month earlier that Norilsk planned to issue the paper by July.\n",
            "His statement sent Norilsk shares crashing by over 11 percent, and Norilsk ordinaries traded at $6.60 at 1320 GMT on the Russian Trading System. The paper rose 12 percent when the financially troubled company announced the issue.\n",
            "Norilsk is struggling to enact a restructuring plan in which it hopes the state will assume responsibility for financing its vast social infrastructure, including resettling tens of thousands of pensioners.\n",
            "Parshikov said efforts to push through restructuring would intensify. But Norilsk officials have been unable to say whether a recent board meeting had approved the plan. ($1 = 5,756 roubles)\n",

            "Property developers and analysts said the measures announced on Wednesday were not only inappropriate in a free-wheeling society but also may not work.\n",
            "\"It is an unwarranted intervention in normal commercial decision-making process,\" the Real Estate Developers' Association of Hong Kong said in a statement.\n",
            "\"It attacks the very foundation of Hong Kong's free market economy principle.\"\n",
            "The government's regulations require developers to put unfinished flats on to the market earlier than before.\n",
            "Private flats must now be put up for sale 15 months before they are ready instead of 12 months previously.\n",
            "For government-subsidised flats, the period has been extended to 24 months from between 12 and 18 months at present.\n",
            "In addition, developers will have to put flats on to the market within six months of the government granting approval for them to sell, and to release no less than 20 percent of every batch of housing units that is built.\n",
            "The moves quickly drew fire.\n",
            "Some analysts said the government was tackling only the symptoms of the problem and not tackling its roots.\n",
            "\"You can go on for eternity producing short-term remedies. All they are doing is dealing with the symptoms at the moment, and not dealing with the actual cause (that) can only be eradicated by planning,\" said Paul Dwyer, head of Vigers Corporate Valuation Consultancy.\n",
            "Another analyst with an Asian firm said the measures could backfire.\n",
            "\"This mere pushing forward of units in an environment where supply is already very tight...if anything, will provide room for more speculation as more units are in the market now,\" he said.\n",
            "\"Prices could rise faster as demand is very strong, so the government is actually shooting itself in the foot,\" he said.\n",
            "While the government's pledge to release some 587 hectares (1,450 acres) of land for residential use earned some bouquets, the property community urged it to do more.\n",
            "\"We've got industrial land but nobody wants to build on industrial space in Hong Kong,\" said Dwyer.\n",
            "\"It's a matter of rezoning this land, putting money in to create the infrastructure and enhancing the environmental atmosphere, then you'll be able to use this land for residential purposes.\"\n",
            "A major property developer, who declined to be identified, criticised as unfair the requirement to push on to the market at least 20 percent of unfinished flats in every batch of units.\n",
            "\"It's like a regulation requiring a restaurant to cook 20 percent of its eggs, 20 percent of its lamb, regardless of whether they have customers outside,\" he told Reuters.\n",
            "Hong Kong's seemingly endless property boom, which has not been threatened by the British territory's imminent handover to Chinese rule, was highlighted this week when developer Sino Land Co Ltd paid a record HK$11.82 billion (US$1.53 billion) for a residential site on Hong Kong island.\n",

            "He told Reuters in an interview that 38,000 tonnes of cargo had been moved to and from Hong Kong on Northwest's trans-Pacific routes which had seen unusual highs and lows over the past year.\n",

            "\"We are now looking at more or less the same volume as last year. 1996 was not as healthy as 1994 and 1995. The first three months of the year were unexpectedly slow for us and we lost US$6 million and eight million pounds of freight. The business just was not there, regardless of the price we were charging. We have always been trying to catch up since then,\" Wong said.\n",
            "\"Yield has picked up a little bit over the past two months but is still way below the 1995 level, I would say 8-10 per cent below,\" Wong added.\n",

            "Sophie L'Helias, ex-Wall Street lawyer, shareholder lobbyist and columnist, has added author to her CV with the publication this month of a book on French corporate governance.\n",
            "\"The Return of the Shareholder\", published by Gualino, is essentially a guide for anyone involved in corporate life or owns shares, and maps out French corporate governance and the British and U.S. models.\n",
            "L'Helias, 33, has shaken up the sometimes cosy boardrooms of French firms with campaigns to boost shareholder value and hold boards accountable to small investors, notably through a proxy shareholder solicitation of Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel SA /Plc.\n",
            "L'Helias, whose rapid-fire English and scathing American humour belie her French origins, has drawn on her international legal training and advocacy experience to analyse French corporate practice, which she concludes is in need of reform.\n",
            "\"The French model will inevitably undergo significant change in coming years as the current procedures which govern the workings and control of companies and the balance of power between the directors on the one hand and investors on the other, have shown themselves to be inappropriate,\" she writes in the opening chapter.\n",
            "CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM OR SLANGING MATCH?\n",
            "A glaring gap in the French landscape is a lack of an obligation for companies to issue a compliance statement, which serves as a benchmark to judge firms on their code of conduct.\n",
            "That forces an adversarial role on shareholders who have to ask firms what their view of best practice is.\n",
            "The corporate governance issue is not a fad but goes to the heart of the complex relationship between company managers and investors, and relates to the performance and expectations of each side, she argues.\n",
            "\"Constructive dialogue\" is how L'Helias terms the future relations between directors and shareholders, rather than the \"dialogue of the deaf\" which characterises many of the thumbnail sketches she scatters throughout the book, such as Alcatel Alsthom, International Business Machines and British Gas Plc Plc.\n",
            "The book comes at a time of great change as the French system of \"managed capitalism\" evolves to a new system of what could be called \"shareholder capitalism\".\n",
            "The old regime reserved a special role for the government and saw firms run with an eye to serving the national interest and those of family owner-managers and employees, L'Helias says.\n",
            "But with the rollback of the state through privatisations, the increasing presence of British and American investors, and the long-awaited arrival of private pension funds, French boards are having to adapt to new performance standards.\n",
            "Company boards are being pushed to explain strategies, focus on objectives and increase shareholder returns, she adds.\n",
            "HAVE LAW DEGREES, WILL LOBBY\n",
            "L'Helias organised a ground-breaking proxy vote solicitation for a key Eurotunnel shareholders meeting in June 1996. With the backing of one of the Eurotunnel shareholders association and Investir magazine, she secured proxies for a blocking minority of 33 percent of the votes.\n",
            "The aim was to ensure the small shareholders' voice was heard as the company negotiated with its bankers on a restructuring of its 70 billion franc ($12.2 billion) junior bank debt.\n",
            "L'Helias also acted in 1995 for a New York-based fund, Elliott Associates, which was pushing for the board of a French investment fund, Cie d'Investissement de Paris (CIP), to narrow the discount on its shares relative to net asset value.\n",
            "The following year, the investment bank SBC Warburg consulted L'Helias as it prepared an offer to buy out CIP from majority owner Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP).\n",
            "BNP, which had launched a buy out for CIP, rejected the SBC Warburg offer, and completed it own buy-out.\n",
            "L'Helias was educated at universities in Saarbruck, Germany, Paris' Sorbonne, Pennsylvania in the United States, and gained an MBA at the Insead European business school at Fontainebleau in France.\n",
            "She was a lawyer in a Wall Street law firm in the 1980s buy-out boom and worked briefly in the London office of Merrill Lynch and opened her Franklin Global Investor Services (FGIS) consultancy in 1994.\n",
            "\"I am not a shareholder activist,\" she said. She plays an advocacy role, typically retained by a big shareholder who wants her to persuade companies to improve returns. The aim is not to humiliate managements but to use reason and argument. \"Most of the time, the work is quiet and but sometimes it goes public -- like in Eurotunnel,\" she said.\n",
            "L'Helias also writes a column on corporate governance in the separate French and Swiss Agefi financial newspapers. ($ = 5.718 French Francs)\n",

            "A Czech appeals court rejected on Tuesday a move by a group of minority shareholders to invalidate a $1.32 billion 1995 tender which gave a 27 percent stake in fixed-line monopoly SPT Telecom a.s. to a Dutch-Swiss consortium, SPT said.\n",
            "The decision, which overturns a lower court ruling, means the Telsource consortium, combining PTT Netherlands and Swiss Telecom, will remain SPT's largest shareholder after the Czech government, which still holds a majority stake.\n",
            "The lawsuit concerned the validity of a decision at an SPT general meeting held in February 1995, setting up the tender which at the time was the largest privatisation in post-Communist Europe.\n",
            "The action was brought by a group of Czech investors who contended former Economics Minister Karel Dyba did not have authority to represent the state in voting at a general meeting which approved the plan for SPT to take on a strategic partner.\n",
            "A second suit over another general meeting in August 1995 is still under review, but the decision on Tuesday is a setback for the group which has been agressively challenging the tender.\n",
            "The Dutch-Swiss consortium bid $1.32 billion in cash, and another $131 million in services, to win the tender over four other international telecom groups, promising to double the country's network to more than four million lines by the end of the century.\n",
            "SPT said after the decision that the ruling on Tuesday would help its creditibility with investors, after large finance programmes were held up because of the lawsuits. \"The decision only confirms the integrity of the current view of our company and thus all resolutions of the SPT general meeting are valid,\" SPT's chairman Lubos Rezabek said in a statement.\n",
            "A second lawsuit, brought by the same group led by Czech businessman Martin Mosinger, concerns the conduct of a general meeting in August 1995 where the transaction won final approval.\n",
            "\"I believe that the second suit... will soon be concluded to our benefit and it will put an end to questions regarding the SPT privatisation,\" Rezabek said.\n",
            "SPT last April mandated U.S.-based banks Chase Manhattan and Citibank to arrange a $500 million, five-year syndicated loan to part finance the firm's long-term development programme.\n",

            "Britain's final departure next year from its colony of Hong Kong will be sealed with a handshake, a British minister said on Tuesday, confirming the two countries would share one final last symbolic embrace.\n",
            "Beijing's top Hong Kong policymaker had indicated he was willing to join the British territory's last imperial governor at a ceremony to mark its return to China, said Jeremy Hanley, Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n",
            "Chinese official Lu Ping's willingness to join Britain's Governor Chris Patten in the limelight appeared to signal new willingness to set aside differences in the run-up to the colony's return to Beijing rule on July 1, 1997.\n",
            "\"I had confirmation from Lu Ping this morning that he is looking forward to shaking the governor's hand at the handover ceremony,\" Hanley told a news conference in Beijing.\n",
            "London and Beijing have long bickered over the arrangements for Hong Kong's mid-1997 transition to Chinese rule after more than 150 years, with disagreement over the handover ceremony once so entrenched that the prospects for a joint event seemed doubtful.\n",
            "Beijing, infuriated by Patten's drive to expand democracy in the colony ahead of its return, has tried to limit Britain's role, while London is keen to leave in imperial style.\n",
            "Britain in March signaled that a joint ceremony was in doubt, with diplomatic sources reporting that the main hurdle in talks was China's insistence that Patten should not attend.\n",
            "Hong Kong government radio reported late last month that Chinese and British negotiators could reach an outline agreement on the ceremony by the end of September, just nine months before the end of London's rule.\n",
            "A willingness to share the podium with the governor could reflect a muting of Chinese anger at Patten, who has long been the butt of scathing editorials in the Beijing media.\n",
            "Lu Ping has frequently shown reluctance to meet Patten during visits to the colony, although he has often had conferences with other British and Hong Kong officials.\n",
            "Hanley said differences remained to be settled on handover arrangements, but added progress had been made.\n",
            "\"We've had very useful discussions,\" he said.\n",
            "\"On the handover ceremony, the Chinese government agree that it should be grand, solemn and dignified, and fitting to the historical importance of the event,\" Hanley said.\n",
            "Britain and China say relations have warmed in recent months, boosted by high-level exchanges and a May trade visit to Beijing by British Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine.\n",
            "Differences remained over China's determination to scrap Hong Kong's elected legislature, known as Legco, Hanley said.\n",
            "\"It is unnecessary for Legco, which has been duly elected, to be replaced before the end of its term in 1999,\" he said.\n",
            "While Hanley called for urgency to resolve outstanding disagreements before the 1997 handover, China's official Xinhua news agency quoted Lu Ping as saying \"minor differences\" did not necessarily have to be ironed out before the day arrived.\n",
            "\"We will try our best to solve minor differences before the first of July, 1997. If some of the differences cannot be solved by that day, it doesn't matter,\" Lu said. \"They can be resolved gradually by the Hong Kong people themselves.\"\n",

            "3Com Corp and U.S. Robotics Corp's merger promises to create a second powerhouse in the data networking industry capable of competing head-to-head in the Internet access business with Cisco Systems Inc.\n",
            "The merger, valued at $6.6 billion in stock, represents the largest such deal ever in the computer network industry.\n",
            "But analysts were divided on whether the merger by two of the top six network equipment suppliers will be strong enough to offer end-to-end network connections on the scale of Cisco.  \n",
            "\"No more Cisco and the Seven Dwarfs,\" Bear Stearns analyst Eric Blachno said, invoking an analogy frequently heard in the industry to describe Cisco's dominant market leadership.\n",
            "\"It appears the Cisco has acquired a large competitor,\" he said in reaction to the latest industry consolidation move.\n",
            "However, veteran industry analyst Frank Dzubeck questioned the viability of combining the two companies in light of precedents set by previous mega-mergers in the industry.  \n",
            "\"This could be another Bay-Wellfleet-Synoptics deal,\" he said, referring to the 1994 merger that formed Bay Networks Inc, a union seen as running aground over conflicts in integrating product lines, company cultures and managements.\n",
            "Similarly, Dzubeck, president of Communications Networks Architects Inc, an industry consulting firm, said 3Com and U.S. Robotics represented \"two cultures, two different product streams, two managements.\"\n",
            "\"A lot depends on how they meet the organizational challenges,\" the analyst said of the complexities inherent in combining companies centered about 2,000 miles apart.  \n",
            "3Com is headquartered in Santa Clara, Calif., the heart of Silicon Valley, while U.S. Robotics is located in Skokie, Ill.\n",
            "3Com is known as the leading maker of network adapter cards used to connect personal computers to office networks. Roughly 40 percent of its $2.3 billion in fiscal 1996 revenues were derived from adapter card sales, analysts say.\n",
            "By contrast, Robotics is the top maker of computer modems for consumers and other products providing Internet access.\n",
            "The $1.9 billion company also sells switchboard-like data communications hubs, which Internet Service Providers (ISPs) use to handle scores of simultaneous incoming consumer calls.  \n",
            "\"The whole concept of those two companies getting together is a very strong one,\" said Paul Deninger, chief executive of Broadview Associates, a high-technology investment banking firm, when asked Tuesday to speculate on rumors of the merger.\n",
            "\"Robotics is a remote access company,\" Deninger said. \"3Com has no remote access strategy. This provides them one.\"\n",
            "While Deninger is an active dealmaker in the networking industry -- completing 24 smaller technology acquisition deals in the last 18 months -- the latest merger was managed by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, according to the companies.  \n",
            "In a conference call, executives of the two companies said 3Com's strength as a corporate equipment supplier and U.S. Robotics' strong retail presence would allow the company to compete in both local-area and wide-area networks.\n",
            "But several industry analaysts said rather than allowing 3Com to compete head-to-head in every market segment of the networking industry, the merger was best seen as allowing it to create a defensible niche in important segments.  \n",
            "3Com Chairman and Chief Executive Eric Benhamou acknowledged as much in saying his company's strengths lie at what he called \"the edge of the network\" -- selling products to connect office workers and consumers to computer networks.\n",
            "\"We are much stronger at the edge of the network,\" Benhamou said, allowing that archrival Cisco dominates the core of office networks and long-distance \"backbone\" networks.\n",
            "Cisco's strength in the larger network equipment used to build these portions of computer networks was bolstered by a major acquisition of its own last April, when it paid about $4 billion to acquire Stratacom Inc.  \n",
            "The combination of 3Com and Robotics comes no where near Cisco in several vital respects. Their combined revenues are running at roughly $5 billion a year, officials said, compared with Cisco's current annual run rate of more than $6 billion.\n",
            "But Cisco's daunting advantages become more apparent when the underlying growth rates of the companies are compared.\n",
            "While the 3Com and Robotics businesses are estimated to be growing at 40 percent per year -- a healthy rate by most any industry measure -- Cisco continues to outrun all major competitors by its explosive 80 percent per year pace.\n",
            "\"That's an amazing growth rate,\" Deninger said of Cisco's market momentum. \"Especially since no one else in the industry is growing faster than 40 percent,\" he said.\n",
            "Across a variety of measures Cisco remains the dominant player in the industry, followed by a 3Com/Robotics combination, Bay Networks Inc and Cabletron Systems Inc.\n",

            "The bourse has showed signs of rebounding recently -- gaining in 15 of the past 16 sessions. But analysts saw little change in market sentiment amid mostly domestic trading as investment funds settled positions before the end of the year.\n",
            "\"This doesn't really look like a rebound to me. (Mainly) there's a bit of domestic buying and some of the local brokers are just bidding up the market,\" Alex Angell of the brokerage Wood and Company said.\n",

            "Although eastern Europe's most-capitalised bourse, the Czech market has long been plagued by poor legislation that investors say fails to provide protection for minority shareholders.\n",
            "Under the Czech Republic's Securities Act, devised to handle the logistics of the government's massive voucher privatisation scheme, the Securities Registry (SCP) is bound by law to provide services such as moving securities to and from client accounts.\n",
            "Since the SCP does not reveal any details of transactions, including prices and volumes, local brokers have taken to the SCP because of its privacy and faster settlement process.\n",
            "But this has restrained activity on the PSE which sees on average $4-6 million of stock turnover each day, compared with $15 million in Warsaw, a much smaller market.\n",
            "\"There are clearly investors who have decided to stay away from this market because of its opaqueness and are still on the sidelines,\" said one international trader.\n",

            "They expected investors to buy back into the market as the downtrend bottoms out, though maybe not not before year's end.\n",
            "\"I expect most of the buying to come in the New Year, but I think it means that investors already familiar with the market should do something now,\" said Danial Gladis, head of the brokerage Atlantik Financni Trhy.\n",
            "Market officials have also begun taking steps to correct the problems which should slowly lure back disenchanted investors.\n",
            "In April, parliament approved a series of market reforms to compel companies and fund managers to be more open and accountable. A key element tackles the chronic problem of slow and irregular reporting of company earnings and actions.\n",

            "A report on the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) news service said late on Wednesday that Ford was set to announce the axing of 1,500 jobs at Thursday's meeting.\n",
            "But a spokesman from Ford refused to comment on the rising tide of speculation about the plant's future.\n",
            "\"Ford has issued no statement to the press on a reduction in the workforce or restructuring of any plants in Britain,\" said the spokesman on Wednesday.\n",
            "A statement is due from the company at midday on Thursday. The unions involved, led by the Transport and General Workers Union, will hold a press briefing at the plant.\n",
            "But the unions also said late on Wednesday that they were unaware of any confirmation of job cuts from Ford ahead of the make-or-break meeting.\n",
            "Ford's group boss Alex Trotman warned last year the group planned to take draconian action to end heavy losses in Europe and British newspaper have reported in recent days that Ford threatened to close the Halewood plant in northwest England unless new productivity targets were met.\n",

            "The Federal Communications Commission, in resolving a long-standing dispute among its four comissioners, said it will limit the April 1 sale to the four companies that had applied by the end of 1992 to offer digital audio radio -- instead of opening the auction to any company.\n",
            "The four are: CD Radio Inc. of Washington, D.C.; American Mobile Radio Corp., a unit of American Mobile Satellite Corp. of Reston, Va.; Digital Broadcast Satellite Corp. of Seattle; and Primosphere LP of New York.\n",
            "To receive the service -- which is at least three years away -- listeners will have to buy a special radio receiver that will cost about $200, in addition to the price of a regular radio, according to industry estimates.\n",
            "It is likely the service will be subscription-based, with an expected cost of about $10 a month. Operators will be able to offer specialised programming.\n",
            "CD Radio, which pioneered the digital radio concept, plans to provide 30 channels of commercial-free music programming if it wins one of the two licenses up for grabs.\n",
            "The company would target persons who drive a lot or live in rural areas and do not have access to many radio stations.\n",
            "Industry officials say it will take anywhere from three to six years to get the new service operating. \"It's a long lead time in building satellites and getting rocket-launch assignments,\" said Primosphere's Cliff Burnstein.\n",
            "FCC Chairman Reed Hundt and Commissioner Susan Ness had favoured opening the auction of the licenses to any bidders, instead of limiting it to the four.\n",
            "But they were unable to get the other two commissioners at the FCC -- Rachelle Chong and James Quello -- to agree.\n",
            "\"I would prefer to assign spectrum licenses through an auction open to all. Closing the auction is the wrong result,\" Hundt said in a statement.\n",
            "An open auction could have raised a larger sum for the government by attracting more deep-pocketed bidders.\n",
            "Hundt noted recently that MCI Communications Corp. last year paid $683 million to win the last remaining satellite slot to beam television programmes nationwide.\n",

            "\"I don't think there's much more in that Harnischfeger bid than what's in there, and I don't think there's anyone else out there\" that would make a higher bid, Thomas Burns Jr., analyst at NatWest Securities, said.  \n",
            "Shares of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin-based Giddings &amp; Lewis jumped 6-3/4 to 20-3/8 Monday. That was seen as an indication that some buyers expect a higher bid, a view many analysts take issue with.\n",
            "\"My feeling is at $19 a share, that's full value, I think, for Giddings &amp; Lewis,\" said William Cooke, analyst at McDonald &amp; Co. \"I think that Harnischfeger is assuming they can double the earnings of Giddings &amp; Lewis in the not too distant future. I think they're being optimistic.\"  \n",
            "Harnischfeger said it is looking at using Giddings &amp; Lewis to expand in the fragmented industrial products aftermarket service business, which Harnischfeger estimates as an $80 billion market.\n",
            "But some analysts said buying Giddings &amp; Lewis, a company that took a $64.1 million charge last year to try to fix its integrated automation systems business, adds a lot of uncertainty for Harnischfeger shareholders.  \n",
            "\"...we believe that investors will be looking at a fundamentally different company with much more risk involved than they had previously,\" J. Blair Brumley, analyst at Dain Bosworth, wrote in a research note, in which he also lowered the rating of Harnischfeger to a hold from a buy.\n",
            "While saying the Harnischfeger bid was not a done deal, \"we expect (Harnischfeger) to pursue its target with vigor and would be suprised if another offer significantly higher than the one now on the table would surface,\" Brumley said.  \n",
            "Some analysts said Harnischfeger has picked a perfect time to go after Giddings &amp; Lewis. Giddings has already taken steps to fix its underperforming operations, but the stock, in their opinion, still is ailing, they said.\n",
            "\"They got all the dirty work behind them,\" said Darren Bagwell, analyst at Robert W. Baird &amp; Co Inc. \"They've wiped the slate clean, and yet the stock price still reflects that wait and see attitude.\"\n",
            "In fact, Bagwell also said Giddings &amp; Lewis could probably squeeze a higher bid out of somebody and said he felt the company was worth more than $19 a share.\n",
            "Some analysts also noted that Harnischfeger's bid was likely based only on publicly available information and that a bidder who had a good look at Giddings &amp; Lewis books might find information to convince them to make a higher offer.\n",
            "Harnischfeger shares were down 3-5/8 at 41-3/4 Monday.\n",

            "\"There has been an agreement by all economies to adopt the strategy of going towards open trade and liberalisation in trade in telecommunications,\" Australian Telecommunications Minister Richard Alston told reporters.\n",
            "Alston, who hosted the second Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) ministerial meeting on telecommunications and the information industry, said APEC could not push member countries to conform to a uniform policy.\n",
            "\"It is not a regional government. It is not intended to drag unwilling players along a path that the majority thinks desirable,\" Alston said when asked about reports that China was reluctant to adopt telecom liberalisation.\n",
            "\"Whilst there might be some domestic reservations about particular aspects, the overall guiding principles are well recognised. You simply don't find a member economy that does not espouse the principles of the reforms in this area,\" he said.\n",
            "Alston said China was connecting 15 million telephone lines a year but still had one of the lowest penetration rates of fixed telephone lines among the 18 APEC nations.\n",
            "\"The challenges and the enormity of scale of operations of that country can hardly be compared to countries such as PNG (Papua New Guinea) and Brunei...and so that is why you would have to allow for different views,\" he said at the end of the three-day meeting.\n",
            "Alston said he was hopeful Malaysia, the only member of the forum not to attend, would be at future meetings. Malaysia also did not attend the initial APEC telecommunications ministers meeting in Seoul in 1995.\n",
            "\"We would all hope Malaysia will over time see the benefits that derive from collective discussions,\" Alston said.\n",
            "Although there were no tangible projects from the meeting, ministers agreed on further collaboration on working groups to look at telecommunications for rural development, distance education, information sharing and the environment.\n",
            "\"It would be very short-sighted if we simply committed ourselves to physical rollout without taking into account the effect on the natural environment,\" Alston said.\n",
            "Rapid technological change has brought new challenges such as dealing with the acceptance of electronic commerce and the taxation issues that go with it, he said.\n",
            "\"Undoubtedly, there will be a reluctance to fully embrace electronic commerce and all of its manifestations until we do solve problems of privacy,\" Alston said.\n",
            "He said he expected electronic commerce to be a growing industry once encryption and security issues had been resolved, but taxation issues will start become more important.\n",
            "\"It hasn't yet reached the stage of being an avalanche of siphoning off the revenue from the taxation authorities, but it clearly has some potential in that regard and I think all member economies are aware of the need to handle the issue,\" he said.\n",

            "As baby-boomers age and managed care drives more medical procedures and patients out of high-cost acute-care hospitals, owners of facilities that can look after the aged and the chronically or mildly ill would seem to stand to benefit.\n",
            "\"Just looking at the numbers, this industry should be booming, but it isn't,\" said John Cumming, chief executive of WDI Capital Markets Inc, a healthcare investment banking firm.\n",
            "Growth by acquisition has been the rule in the highly fragmented industry and few firms have shown themselves able to manage it well. The result often has been over-expansion, disarray and restructuring, analysts said.  \n",

            "The Hong Kong Aircrew Officers' Association said Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) is a persistent problem with pilots complaining of a loud buzzing in their ears which forces them to quickly change to another frequency to maintain contact with air traffic control.\n",
            "Hong Kong's Kai Tak is already regarded as one of the world's most difficult airports to land at, and the sources say RFI is an unwelcome addition to a pilot's workload. RFI is widely blamed on mobile phones and pagers being used on illegal frequencies in neighbouring Guangdong province.\n",
            "One Hong Kong-based Boeing 747 freighter pilot, who did not want to be identified, said the problem caused safety concerns.\n",
            "\"It happened to me the other day just after take-off. But the interference is not consistent and they seem to have a problem in tracking it down. It means we sometimes get incomplete radio messages which causes a headache when you least need it. It takes time to change to the back-up frequency and at peak times the airwaves are very crowded. I know of quite a few captains who have filed an occurrence report because of the safety issue involved,\" he said.\n",

            "\"We passed the 30,000 mark this weekend and there is a big acceleration in recent months which I expect to continue in 1997. I think 100,000 should be possible,\" he said.\n",
            "He said that while the French market had developed slower than expected, with a low penetration of personal computers, the AOL subscriber numbers were ahead of planning.\n",
            "The company, a joint-venture between America Online Inc and Bertelsmann of Germany, is sticking to its plan of breaking-even within three years after launch.\n",
            "Le Ficher said that during 1997, AOL would add a number of services, such as train reservations, currently available on France's online Minitel database. He said he expected to have an agreement soon with French banks for financial services such as the consultation of accounts and making money transfers.\n",
            "Electronic commerce, however, was unlikely to really hit France in 1997 because there are as yet insufficient numbers of subscribers.\n",
            "Le Ficher said that at 130,000 subscribers it would become economically viable. Pending that level, AOL France will present a number of French companies, such as the wine and fashion industries, on electronic shopping malls for the Canadian and Japanese versions of the world's biggest service provider.\n",
            "Advertising was also not really taking off. He said that he saw mainly a future in sponsored events -- like AOL's Tour de France coverage which was sponsored by insurer GAN -- than in simple spots.\n",
            "Le Ficher said that he did not fear the arrival of more Internet access providers, who offer a pure access to the worldwide web of computer connections.\n",
            "\"We're addressing the general public, we have a subscription at 49 francs with three hours free use. We are not addressing those people that spend 20 hours on the net,\" he said.\n",

            "Further market entrants are expected in 1997.\n",
            "Le Ficher said that AOL offered \"easily, packaged, aided and thematic\" access to the web and many people needed some support while surfing the net. He said that in France, 40 percent of the time AOL users were connected they were surfing the Internet.\n",
            "\"That means they are also doing other things,\" he said noting that discussion groups were \"massively\" used.\n",

            "The planned changes, though controversial, were expected after China's parliament, or National People's Congress, resolved in late February that a string of existing Hong Kong laws protecting civil liberties and rights should be changed.\n",
            "China's decision, based on the argument that existing laws breach Hong Kong's post-handover constitution, takes effect on July 1, when the British colony of 156 years reverts to China.\n",
            "It will also remove at a stroke democratic freedoms introduced during the office of British Governor Chris Patten, whom China considers an arch-foe.\n",
            "Top civil servant Michael Suen, who has been seconded to Tung's office to help craft the post-handover government, said the changes, outlined in a consultation paper released to the media, were needed because of China's decision.\n",
            "The NPC took the action because China views the political liberalisation of Hong Kong in the twilight years of British rule as a breach of its handover agreements with Britain.\n",
            "\"The reason for this whole exercise is because of the legal vacuum caused by the NPC...so we are inviting public comments on the proposals,\" Suen, secretary for policy coordination, told a news conference.\n",
            "Under the plans, societies and political parties would have to be registered and might be refused registration if they are known to have ties to or receive donations from foreign political organisations or individuals.\n",
            "People wishing to hold demonstrations would have to get permission from police seven days in advance.\n",
            "Demonstrations should only be staged after the police issue a notice of \"no objection\". Under the current system, the police need only be notified beforehand.\n",
            "Suen said the proposals complied with Hong Kong's Basic Law, the post-handover constitution, and were above world standards.\n",
            "\"In working out the proposals, we adhere to the principle that they must be in full compliance with the Basic Law and consistent with the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,\" Suen said.\n",
            "Echoing the well-worn words of his boss, Tung Chee-hwa, Suen also said the changes were necessary to strike a balance between civil liberties and social order.\n",
            "\"We must strike a balance between civil liberties and social stability, personal rights and social obligations, individual interests and the common good,\" Suen said.\n",
            "\"Within the generality of this commitment, we seek to establish broad consensus among the people of Hong Kong as to where the balance should lie.\"\n",
            "The public was invited to give comments on the plans in a pulse-taking exercise over the next three weeks, Suen said.\n",
            "Legislation drafted on the basis of the proposals will be enacted by a controversial China-anointed provisional legislature which replaces the elected Legislative Council on July 1.\n",
            "The departing colonial power Britain, some of its allies and Hong Kong democracy groups have attacked all the moves as a reversal of democratic freedoms in this territory of 6.4 million people.\n",
            "Under the Sino-British agreements on the handover, Hong Kong has been guaranteed a high degree of autonomy for 50 years.\n",

            "MCI Communications Corp on Wednesday said it developed a new network type called Vault which combines conventional voice telephone networks with packet-switched networks like the Internet on a single line.\n",
            "MCI said the cost is part of the $100 million a year it is spending on upgrading its Internet networks. The company plans to earn $2 billion a year in Internet revenues by the end of the century.\n",
            "\"It can be done over a conventional phone line,\" MCI Chief Engineering Officer Fred Briggs told Reuters.\n",
            "For example the technology will allow a customer to talk to and receive computer data from an MCI service representative simultaneously on a single, conventional telephone line by turning the voice into data packets.\n",
            "\"We have been working on this for months,\" Briggs said. He declined to say whether MCI had patented the technology.\n",
            "Customers currently need separate lines to communicate over a telephone network and a packet-switched network.\n",
            "Packet switching means that traffic is divided into manageable chunks and labelled for its ultimate destination. It will be sent via the most convenient route, while conventional phone calls can only travel the route set in advance.\n",
            "Packet switching has a network efficiency benefit. It is the difference between diverting cars away from city congestion and not being able to do the same to bypass a breakdown on the subway.\n",
            "\"From a customer's perspective, communications will be simplified.  The issue of which network a communication travels over will be irrelevant,\" said MCI President and Chief Operating Officer Tim Price.\n",

            "\"The magnitude of the tampering with core samples that we believe has occurred and resulting falsification of assay values at Busang, is of a scale and over a period of time and with a precision that, to our knowledge, is without precedent in the history of mining anywhere in the world,\" the report said.\n",
            "Strathcona said it did not find an economic gold deposit in the southeast zone of the Busang property, the area claimed by Bre-X to contain about 71 million ounces of gold. The report said an economic deposit was unlikely.\n",

Kilborn has already said it was not responsible for sampling.\n",

            "The Japanese government, which has spoken of the benefits of deregulation and leaving the market alone, has taken a strong hand in ensuring that NCB survives, urging other banks to accept newly floated shares to help it rebuild its capital base.\n",
            "The Ministry of Finance (MOF) also said it planned to use 80 billion yen ($645 million) from a special fund created to cope with bad loans from the collapse of \"jusen\" housing loan firms.\n",

            "Just months after giving the Halewood factory near Liverpool its global quality award for 1996, Ford told union leaders the new version of its mid-range Escort would not be built there.\n",
            "The new model is now likely to be built in Spain and Germany. Ford's proposed job cuts will reduce Halewood's workforce to just over 3,000, compared with a peak of 14,000 in the 1960s and around 4,500 now. Britain's Prime Minister John Major told parliament Ford's decision was \"very surprising\" and \"flies in the face of most investment decisions which are moving to the UK\".\n",
            "Ford has not said where the new model will be built. But unions believe the new model, due in 1999, will be built instead at Ford's plants in Valencia, Spain, and Saarlouis, Germany.\n",
            "The main unions, including the Transport and General Workers, announced they would be holding mass meetings at Ford plants around the country over the next week to see whether workers would take action in protest at the job cuts.\n",
            "The workers will be asked to support a motion backing \"all necessary measures, including a ballot for strike action, to secure the future of Halewood and for an equal investment across Europe for all locations\".\n",
            "British car factories were notoriously strike-prone in the 1960s and 1970s but have been barely touched by union action in recent years. Stoppages have fallen to record lows throughout industry in the 1990s.\n",
            "Ford sweetened the pill by saying Halewood could be the site to build a new vehicle, probably a multi-purpose people carrier.\n",
            "Angry workers blamed the decision to cut jobs in Halewood on what they see as a lack of legal protection for British workers.\n",
            "Britain has opted out of European Union's Social Chapter, which sets out minimum working conditions, and its generally looser labour laws make it \"cheaper to dump labour in the UK than on the continent\", one union boss said.\n",
            "\"In Germany, if Ford closes its plant there, it has to pay its people 18 months' pay in compensation. In the UK, we've got no Social Chapter, it's easier to shut us down,\" production line worker Phil Gornall said on his way into the Halewood plant.\n",
            "Industry analysts said Ford's need to cut costs and the failure of the Escort rather than problems at the plant were behind Ford's decision. The Escort's British market share fell to six percent in 1996 from 11 percent or more in the 1980s. Ford Europe lost $472 million in the third quarter of 1996, up from a loss of $320 million in the same 1995 period.\n",
            "Professor Garyl Rhys, a car industry expert at Cardiff university, said Halewood, now a model of industrial relations, was paying for the \"bad old days\" of the 1960s and 1970s, when the British car industry had a bad strike record.\n",
            "\"Because of the problems at Halewood and a number of other car plants in Britain, there was a reluctance to use them as sources for exports...You couldn't guarantee deliveries because of interruptions to production because of strikes,\" he said.\n",
            "Unemployment in the area around Halewood is already a major problem, with some local housing estates suffering from a jobless rate of nearly 40 percent.\n",
            "Local residents complained that shops, banks and supermarkets have closed as businesses moved out of the area, and they seemed resigned to further decline.\n",
            "\"I don't think the government is interested in Liverpool,\" said Mike Kelly, landlord of the Orient pub, used by many of the Ford workers. \"I don't know how long this pub will be here now -- this place is becoming like a ghost town.\"\n",

            "But the overall outlook for Shanghai's office property market remains grim from the developer's point of view -- vacancy rates are around 30 percent and likely to rise to 60 percent by the end of 1997 due to a forest of new buildings, the analysts said.\n",

            "\"There's been a rapid shift in interest with the banks moving over there. The service sector will then follow,\" he said.\n",
            "Leading the leap to Pudong are the foreign banks which have been bluntly told by the Shanghai city government that they will not be able to do local currency business unless they put their headquarters in Pudong.\n",
            "Eight foreign banks have been given approval to do local yuan business in the past month, and they are busy setting up their Pudong operations, while other foreign banks with full branches in Shanghai are lobbying hard to gain the same privilege.\n",

            "\"The vacancy rate (in Pudong) is currently 69.7 percent, but that's to be expected for a newly-developed area,\" he said.\n",
            "\"There's a lot of new supply in 1997, but vacancy rates will probably start to move down,\" he said.\n",
            "With supply far in excess of demand for the foreseeable future, the analysts said they saw Shanghai real estate prices overall sliding further.\n",
            "The foreign banks are paying $20-24 per square metre per month for prime Pudong office space, compared to rates double that or more on the other side of the river in central Shanghai, analysts said.\n",
            "\"Rates (in central Shanghai) are likely to slide over the next couple of years. They may come down to about $30, but what the market is seeing now is that companies that want quality space are willing to pay for it,\" said First Pacific Davies's Crispin.\n",
            "Another real estate broker said he saw the price floor for quality office space in Shanghai at somewhere close to $10-15 per square metre per month.\n",
            "\"The bottom of the pit is the limit, there's too many buildings,\" the broker said. \"But there's still a shortage of really good properties.\"\n",

            "\"The overall occupancy rate is about 30-40 percent, although some of the better buildings are over 50 percent. But it will be three to five years before Pudong property is really fully absorbed,\" the broker said.\n",

            "The Federal Communications Commission has decided against ordering a precipitous cut in the $23 billion long-distance carriers such as AT&amp;T Corp pay the Bells each year for access to their local phone networks, said FCC and industry officials.  \n",
            "Bell executives at one point feared such cuts could cost their companies as much as $10 billion in revenues. Consumer groups and long-distance companies more recently advocate immediate cuts in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion, saying that would mean a similar cut in long-distance rates.\n",
            "\"The Bells have dodged a bullet,\" said analyst Scott Cleland of Schwab Washington Research Group. \"They may get grazed. But they dodged a bullet that was aimed at them during the last six months.\" The rules are set to be voted on next week.\n",
            "Less clear is the impact on phone customers.\n",
            "Those who make lots of long-distance calls would see a sizeable drop in their bill, said FCC and industry officials.\n",
            "But wireless phone subscribers could pay anywhere from one percent to two percent more a month through new fees. Customers with more than one phone line for a computer or the kids and who make few long-distance calls would see a monthly rate rise of around $1 or more.  \n",
            "\"We're cutting away the frills,\" FCC Chairman Reed Hundt said in an interview. He is a big advocate of the rules under consideration that are expected to be voted on next week.\n",
            "\"We're talking about a $1 subsidy per month that we're eliminating for somebody who's connecting a $2,500 computer to that line and purchasing $20 a month of unlimited access,\" Hunt said.\n",
            "Instead of a government-imposed cut, the FCC plans to rely on market powers to lower access charges over time, said FCC and industry officials. That could mean an FCC-imposed loss of Bell revenues of no more than $1 billion the first year.\n",
            "FCC officials, meanwhile, say the plan would yield a cut in long-distance charges of more than $1 billion in year one.  \n",
            "FCC officials are against a steep cut for several reasons.\n",
            "Citing rate hikes by AT&amp;T and MCI Communications Corp late last year, they fear long-distance carriers may not fully pass on the cut to consumers and pocket some of the money. Long-distance executives vow to pass on the cuts.\n",
            "FCC officials also fear a sharp cut would unleash a rise in local phone rates by carriers trying to recoup lost money.\n",
            "\"We're keeping basic residential dial tone at today's price,\" said Hundt.\n",
            "Critics charge the plan -- which could still change before next week -- would mean higher rates. AT&amp;T says long-distance customers will see a $1.5 billion jump at the outset in July.\n",
            "\"Regulators appear unlikely to squeeze the fat out of the Bells' prices, leaving consumers paying for inflated rates,\" said Gene Kimmelman of Consumers Union.\n",
            "But Hundt says that over the next five years at least $10 billion \"will be transferred to consumers\" via access cuts.\n",
            "The plan also would pay for $3 billion to connect schools, libraries and rural hospitals to the Internet and provide cheap phone service for the poor.  \n",
            "Access charges were created after the 1984 breakup of Ma Bell. Experts agree the $23 billion is more than the cost of providing access to the local phone network. But they cannot agree on the amount.\n",
            "FCC officials said 85 percent of the nation's 80 million residential phone customers would see a lower monthly bill.\n",
            "Those who make lots of long-distance calls would benefit the most, because the agency plans to replace some of the existing per-minute access charges with a monthly flat rate.\n",
            "The 15 percent of residents who do not make long-distance calls would see their bills stay the same. The monthly flat rate \"subscriber line charge\" customers pay to the local phone company is likely to remain $3.50.\n",
            "But customers with more than one line and who make few long-distance calls are likely to see a rate rise.\n",
            "That's because the ceiling, or cap, on the subscriber line charge is expected to rise to $5 a month from $3.50 for each additional residential line, and to roughly $7 a line for multi-line business customers from $6 a month.\n",
            "One possible way around the charge may be for customers to list their additional lines in a different name or use another local carrier, said industry officials.  \n",
            "Meanwhile, large businesses or consumers who make a lot of long-distance calls could well see a drop in their phone bill because the FCC plans to lower the permanent access charge to about two cents a minute from about 5.4 cents.\n",
            "To make up the lost revenues, the FCC plans to require long-distance carriers to pay local carriers a new monthly \"pre-subscribed line charge\" for each long-distance customer.\n",
            "The charge -- which will range from 75 cents a month for single-line residents to $4.50 a month a line for multi-line businesses -- are intended to better reflect the actual costs of using the local phone network.\n",

            "French defence electronics firm Thomson-CSF , soon to be sold by the state, posted 1996 results on Wednesday showing a return to profit after three years of heavy losses.\n",
            "Thomson-CSF reported a net attributable profit of 745 million francs ($129 million) compared with a net loss of 791 million for 1995. Sales were up 2.2 percent at 36.27 billion.\n",
            "The return to the black was mainly due to the sale of Thomson-CSF's 19 percent stake in the troubled state-owned bank Credit Lyonnais.\n",
            "\"Thomson-CSF has been able to return to a profitable footing, as the bank no longer weighs on the accounts of the company, which is now completely centred on defence electronics,\" chairman Marcel Roulet told an analysts' meeting.\n",
            "The state, after a bungled first attempt, is trying to privatise Thomson-CSF as part of a defence industry restructuring which may have an impact on the entire European sector.\n",
            "Roulet said he expected the terms and conditions drawn up by the government on the privatisation would be published soon. \"It is a question of a few days or a week.\" The Privatisation Commission has to vet the terms to allow the sale to go ahead.\n",
            "French engineering and telecommunications giant Alcatel Alsthom has teamed up with fighter-aircraft maker Dassault Aviation and state-owned Aerospatiale to bid for Thomson-CSF.\n",
            "Missiles-to-publishing group Lagardere is also bidding, supported by British Aerospace Plc (BAe) .\n",
            "Thomson-CSF said in a statement that operating profit rose 5.6 percent to 2.07 billion francs despite a reduction in military budgets and tougher markets. The improvement was due to better competitiveness following restructuring efforts pursued over a number of years.\n",
            "The net result was dented by an exceptional charge of 824 million francs, compared with 753 million in the prior year, to cover restructuring costs tied to the shrinking of markets and cost-cutting measures, it said.\n",
            "Pre-tax pre-exceptional profit rose 12 percent to 2.04 billion francs, reflecting the productivity gains and lower financial charges. Financial costs fell to 27 million francs from 135 million, due to lower interest rates and favourable currency movements.\n",
            "Consolidated pretax profit was 1.30 billion francs, versus a loss of 437 million, which included a 101 million franc hit from its the sale of its holding in Credit Lyonnais.\n",
            "The previous three years' losses at Thomson-CSF were essentially due to falls in the value of Credit Lyonnais shares, which were taken on Thomson-CSF's accounts to reflect its equity stake.\n",

            "Countries belonging to the World Trade Organization should be flexible and understanding about China's bid to join the WTO, the organization's director-general said on Saturday.\n",
            "\"As we approach the final stage of the Chinese accession process, there is a need for flexibility on all sides and a determination to resolve the crucial outstanding issues in the negotiations,\" Renato Ruggiero told trade ministers from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.\n",
            "\"The success of this negotiation is a shared responsibility, and it can be assured only if we keep up the momentum established earlier this year,\" Ruggiero said.\n",

            "The APEC members said they wanted China and Russia to join the WTO quickly, as long as they join on commercially viable terms, officials said.\n",
            "The world's major trading partners have suggested that China join last year's international agreement to open up trade in information technology before it acceeds to the 130-member World Trade Organization.\n",
            "Ruggiero said that talks on financial services have become the WTO's top priority.\n",
            "\"A success in financial services is essential to help ensure each of you -- industrialized and developing countries alike -- the necessary infrastructure growth,\" Ruggiero told the Asia-Pacific trade ministers.\n",
            "\"My message is: do not see this negotiation in North/South terms,\" he continued. \"On the contrary, developing countries whatever their economic position, have an even stronger need than the industrial countries for competitive financial institutions.\"\n",
            "Ruggiero urged APEC to make sure a financial services deal is reached this year, to maintain momentum in international trade talks.\n",
            "\"Not to  do so should be as unthinkable as it would be short-sighted,\" Ruggiero said.\n",

            "On Saturday, the 18 APEC countries affirmed their support too, building strong momentum for a deal by the end of the year in the lucrative sector, officials said.\n",
            "But U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky warned Saturday that some countries in Latin America and Asia need to be more generous with their offers. The United States pulled out of previous attempts to broker free trade in financial services because of its disappointment in offers from other countries.\n",
            "The meeting between the WTO leader and the APEC trade ministers confirmed APEC's role as a regional catalyst for action within the WTO, trade officials said.\n",

            "TVX Gold Inc is taking steps to join the ranks of major mining companies, bringing aboard three senior executives who pledge to turn the company into a million-ounce-a-year gold producer.\n",
            "\"We're here to help TVX grow,\" said Cliff Davis, the new senior vice-president of North American operations, among three officers who joined TVX in the past month.\n",
            "\"We understand the need for organization. We understand realistic plans. I think that's something we can help TVX with,\" Davis told Reuters in an interview.  \n",
            "Davis's next plan is to speed production at the New Britannia mine in Manitoba and develop more reserves at Casa Berardi in Quebec.\n",
            "Joining Davis at TVX are David Murray, the recently appointed president and chief operating officer, and Ken Sangster as senior vice-president of European operations.\n",
            "The three have worked together before. They did stints at mining giant RTZ-CRA Corp Plc and have years of experience with huge projects.  \n",
            "\"For us it was a perfect fit,\" said TVX spokesman Ed Baer. \"One of the things that was a common concern to the market was our lack of management.\"\n",
            "Toronto-based TVX split off from Inco Ltd in 1993 and has concentrated on expanding its assets.\n",
            "With its interests now growing in Canada, Greece, Brazil, Ecuador, Chile, the Czech Republic and Russia, the company is ready to switch its focus to production, he said.\n",
            "TVX has promised its shareholders it will be producing 1.1 million ounces of gold a year by the year 2000 from 423,000 ounces in 1995.  \n",
            "To help keep its promise, the company has placed its bets on the Kassandra Mines in Greece. \"If everything works for us, the story really lies in Greece,\" said Baer.\n",
            "The property so far is expected to produce 300,000 ounces of gold a year at a cash cost of US$150 an ounce. TVX was still drilling and would not have a clear idea until next spring what the deposit offered, said Baer.\n",
            "Uncertainty over Kassandra has unsettled TVX stock. Its shares peaked at 14.85 in Toronto during a road show and high gold bullion prices last winter. But the stock has since slid.  \n",
            "With its stock now trading around 10 on the Toronto Stock Exchange and around 7.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, TVX has been rumored as a takeover target for some major gold producers.\n",
            "But as a growing company, TVX is always looking for joint ventures and is on the prowl for small mining companies with proven reserves, Baer said.\n",
            "Davis's first move at TVX was to shut the company's gold mine in Montana earlier this month.\n",
            "The Mineral Hill mine drained money from the company for years. TVX hoped to revive it with additional ore found at nearby Crevice Mountain, but ore grades at Mineral Hill grew worse and the company could not keep its mill supplied.\n",
            "Although the company continues to explore at Crevice, Davis did not hold out much hope for a resurrection of mining on the property.\n",

            "BSkyB, the dominant force in British pay TV, confirmed that it would proceed later this year with the launch of digital satellite into this country.\n",
            "It said that the plan was not affected by its new digital terrestrial television (DTT) alliance with leading commercial broadcasters Carlton Communications and Granada Group .\n",
            "The three have teamed up to form British Digital Broadcasting and apply for licences to run DTT networks when the 30-channel service comes on air in Britain in mid-1998.\n",
            "\"BSkyB is positioning itself to become a key player in digital,\" chief executive Sam Chisholm told a news conference.\n",
            "\"Digital satellite is going to be the primary driver (of the new technology) as it offers such a wide range of services,\" Chisholm added.\n",
            "BSkyB, in which Rupert Murdoch's News Corp is the leading shareholder, earlier said pre-tax profit rose 26 percent to 133.7 million pounds ($214.4 million) in the six months to end-December, up from 106.3 million a year ago.\n",
            "It reported record subscriber growth of 434,000 in the last three months of last year and now has over six million customers in Britain and Ireland.\n",

            "BSkyB said it expected shortly to confirm an order for up to one million digital satellite decoders from four manufacturers as it gears up for an autumn launch.\n",
            "It plans to work with partners to offer interactive services such as home shopping and home banking as part of the digital satellite package.\n",
            "Chisholm said a new company would be formed to subsidise the digital satellite decoder so that it could retail for around 200 pounds. A decoder is needed to view any digital service.\n",
            "He did not name the members of the company, but BSkyB is reported to have had talks with British Telecommunications, Japanese electronics company Matsushita and bankers HSBC.\n",
            "BSkyB remained optimistic about the prospects for digital television in Germany, playing down the initial slow take-up recorded by Kirch Gruppe's DF1.\n",
            "\"If you can get it right, it's a hell of an opportunity,\" said Chisholm, noting that there are some 37 million German-speaking households in Europe.\n",
            "BSkyB agreed last year to take a stake of up to 49 percent in DF1 but is yet to invest any money in the venture.\n",
            "DF1 was launched last July but recent reports suggest it has only attracted 20,000 subscribers. Chisholm said that DF1's slow take-up was partly the result of market confusion.\n",
            "DF1 has been locked in a war with Premiere, another German pay-TV venture. Kirch owns 25 percent of Premiere but has fallen out with partners Bertelsmann and Canal Plus, who hold the remaining 75 percent.\n",

            "HP said the proposed acquisition would combine its strength as the second-largest U.S.-based computer equipment company with VeriFone's leadership in electronic commerce. VeriFone had net revenue of $472 million in its 1996 fiscal year.\n",
            "The acquisition price of about $1.18 billion was based on HP's closing stock price of $50.50 a share Tuesday. HP's stock slipped by $1 to $49.50 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was one of the most heavily traded issues.\n",

            "Northern Electric Plc on Tuesday lost its bitterly-fought battle to stay independent when it finally fell victim to a 782 million pound ($1.31 billion) hostile bid from U.S. utility CalEnergy Co Inc.\n",
            "CalEnergy's CE Electric won control of the privatised British regional electricity company (REC) with a wafer-thin majority, gaining the support of only 50.3 percent of the votes. The margin was a mere 300,000 shares.\n",
            "The bid was so closely fought it ran over its original deadline and the outcome was in doubt right down to the wire.\n",
            "Insurer Prudential Corp stepped in at the eleventh hour to try and thwart CE's efforts, by buying up nearly one million Northern shares from investors who had previously accepted CE's bid.\n",
            "CE Electric's chairman and chief executive David Sokol said, \"We look forward to working with Northern Electric's management to put in place a smooth transition.\"\n",
            "\"We are delighted by the outcome of the final offers for Northern Electric's shareholders,\" he said in a statement.\n",
            "Northern Electric had no comment to make immediately after the result was published.\n",
            "Last Friday's original bid deadline was extended to 1300 GMT on Tuesday after CE protested about share buys by Northern's advisers Schroders and BZW and a 250,000 pound fee to BZW not disclosed until Friday.\n",
            "On Monday an appeal by Northern to reverse the deadline extension was rejected by the Takeover Panel, which polices mergers and acquisitions in the City of London.\n",
            "Analysts said the takeover battle will leave a number of questions to be answered over the role of advisors.\n",
            "The bid was the second hostile takeover that Northern had faced -- it spent 560 million pounds fending off Trafalgar House, now owned by Norway's Kvaerner.\n",
            "Northern, the first privatised power company to become a takeover target, initially received a billion pound bid from Trafalgar House at the end of 1994.\n",
            "But the offer was scuppered when industry regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild, announced plans for more stringent price controls, sending electricity share prices tumbling.\n",
            "Northern's demise marks the tenth of the 12 cash-rich RECS privatised in 1990 to be taken over since they became available when the government's golden share expired in March 1995.\n",
            "It is also the fourth to be taken over by an American company with two further agreed bids from U.S. firms Dominion Resources and Entergy for East Midlands and London respectively currently underway.\n",
            "American companies are hotly tipped as the most likely buyers for the remaining RECs as they find the British regulatory environment more relaxed and see them as a useful springboard for expansion into Europe.\n",
            "Among potential bidders, analysts named Houston Industries, which failed in its attempt to secure control of Norweb with Central &amp; South West Corp in October 1995.\n",
            "Florida Power &amp; Light and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, which have both been rumoured previously to be interested in Recs, are again being eyed as possible buyers.\n",
            "Entergy of the U.S. has just clinched an agreed 1.267 billion pound deal to take over London Electricity, which provides power to the capital and its financial heart, the City.\n",
            "The electricity companies have attracted harsh criticism from lobby groups and the British media over fat executive pay packets, shareholder payouts and spiralling takeover prices.\n",
            "Lang's decision to clear CE Electric's bid on December 6 lifted a cloud from Northern's shares, which had been languishing around 600 pence. It also indicated that other bids might not face any regulatory hurdles.\n",

            "The author of \"Closely Observed Trains\" and over 50 folksy works, fell to his death from the fifth floor of a Prague hospital on Monday where he was being treated for arthritis.\n",
            "Doctors said he fell while apparently trying to trying to feed pigeons. He was 82.\n",
            "\"He wrote ruggedly beautiful texts,\" the former playwright Havel said in a statement released by the president's office.\n",
            "Havel recalled writing a student essay on Hrabal, and joining him at the favourite literary hangout, Cafe Slavia. \"A beautiful friendship connected us throughout life,\" Havel said.\n",
            "On Tuesday, the normal afternoon murmur filled the U Zlateho Tygra (at the Golden Tiger) bar, where Hrabal was a fixture, and where U.S. President Bill Clinton joined the venerable author for a beer during a 1994 state visit.\n",
            "Many of Hrabal's old friends quietly toasted him in the room where a black sash over a picture was the only indication that a Golden Tiger regular would never return.\n",
            "\"He used to sit here, but now he sits everywhere,\" said one regular under a collection of Hrabal memorabilia.\n",
            "Hrabal's subtle political works were suppressed under the Czechoslovak communist authorities but were widely circulated in samizdat photocopies in dissident circles.\n",
            "\"I consider Bohumil Hrabal as one of the greatest prose writers of contemporary time,\" Havel said.\n",
            "The Jiri Menzel film \"Larks on a Thread\" was a biting commentary based on Hrabal's personal stories of a worker's tedious 1950s life after the Communist takeover.\n",
            "A Hrabal revival began soon after the 1989 revolution when \"Larks\", banned by the Communists, was reintroduced, and many of the author's works were finally published legally.\n",
            "Menzel also made Hrabal's quirky \"Closely Observed Trains\", about life at a provincial railway station during World War Two, into an Oscar winner in 1966.\n",
            "Another film, based on Hrabal's \"I Served the King of England\", is set to be released later this year.\n",
            "Havel, the dissident turned president, said he was happy to have been able to award Hrabal the state honour for artists, the Medal for Merit, in 1996.\n",

            "Nike Inc., the world's largest maker of athletic footwear, reported a 24 percent jump in first-quarter profits Monday, reflecting strong demand for its shoes and apparel around the world.\n",
            "The Beaverton, Ore.-based company also announced a two-for-one stock split, its second in two years.\n",
            "For the three months ended Aug. 31, Nike earned $226.1 million, or $1.53 a share, up from $182.1 million or $1.25 a share a year ago. Revenues jumped 34 percent to $2.28 billion from $1.70 billion last year.\n",
            "The earnings were slightly better than the $1.51 a share industry analysts had expected on average.\n",
            "But the company's stock jumped sharply on news that Nike had taken orders for $3.5 billion in footwear and apparel through January, a 66 percent increase over the year-earlier period, analysts said.\n",
            "\"The futures were up beyond anybody's expectations,\" said Shelly Hale Young of Hambrecht &amp; Quist, who said few expected Nike to top the 55 percent increase in advance orders reported three months ago.\n",
            "As a result, she and other analysts raised their Nike earnings estimates for the rest of the year, and Nike stock rose $2.375 to a record close of $121.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.\n",
            "\"Management is very pleased with these results,\" Nike Chairman Phil Knight said in a conference call with analysts and reporters.\n",
            "In a statement, he said Nike's \"brand strength, which many thought was nearing its peak last year, continues to grow unabated in fiscal 1997.\"\n",
            "Indeed U.S. sales of Nike footwear surged 27 percent to over $1 billion in the quarter, while the overall market is growing at only about an 8 percent rate.\n",
            "Young of Hambrecht &amp; Quist said she expected Nike to raise its share of the U.S. footwear market to 43 percent by the end of the fiscal year from 37 percent, with most of the increase coming at the expense of rival Reebok International Ltd.\n",
            "The increase is coming even as Nike imposes a 7 percent rise in the price of its shoes, which can top $100 a pair.\n",
            "Young said Nike's aggressive marketing and focus on footwear technology have given it the edge.\n",
            "\"They have the better shoes and they have the brand that consumers want to buy, and therefore they can increase prices,\" she said.\n",
            "Overseas, where Nike is not as well established in all markets, Nike sales rose 35 percent from last year's first quarter to $781 million, a figure that was hurt by fluctuations in the U.S. dollar.\n",
            "The company also continued its strong performance in ahtletic apparel, where sales surged to $584 million, a 75 percent increase.\n",
            "At the company's annual shareholders meeting in Beaverton, Ore., Knight and others strongly defended the company against rising criticism of its overseas manufacturing practices.\n",
            "Shareholders overwhelmingly defeated a proposal for independent monitoring of the factories introduced by the United Methodist Church.\n",
            "Knight blamed media reports for distorting Nike's record and said the company generally pays twice the minimum wage in countries where it operates.\n",
            "He said the company recently had discovered \"horrible conditions\" among Pakistani workers -- including children -- sewing soccer balls at home under contract for Nike and had worked to establish centralized sewing centers that would eliminate the abuses.\n",
            "Nike outside directors Jill Conway and John Thompson said they had traveled recently to Indonesia and Vietnam and were generally satisfied by factory conditions.\n",

            "The shareholder vote is one of the first major milestones on the road to winning approval for the $23 billion trans-Atlantic merger, which would create a combined company known as Concert Plc with $40.6 billion in revenues.\n",
            "The merger awaits regulatory approvals in Washington, London and Brussels, the headquarters of the European Union. Company officials are confident the merger -- announced in November -- is on track to close in the fall of 1997.\n",
            "The annual meeting, to be held in Wilkes Barre, Pa., two hours north of Philadelphia, is expected to be a quiet affair, with only three items on the agenda -- the shareholder vote, and election of directors and auditors.\n",
            "Wilkes Barre was chosen because it was the hometown of William McGowan, the legendary founder and former chairman of MCI, who died in June 1992. Washington-based MCI is the nation's second largest long distance company.\n",
            "In his speech to shareholders Wednesday, Bert Roberts, MCI's current chairman and chief executive, is expected to focus on the projected benefits of its merger, which creates one of the world's first global communications carriers.\n",
            "One industry analyst briefed by the company said he expected Roberts to reveal some of the early products and services that may result from its ties to British Telecom.\n",
            "Among the possible offerings would be seamless services connecting the United States and Britain, including wireless phone transmission, faxing, electronic mail, voice mail and the Internet, the analyst said.\n",
            "Industry analysts believe the MCI official will also respond to AT&amp;T Corp.'s initiative to offer local phone service using a fixed wireless system attached to the side of a customer's premises as a means of bypassing local networks controlled by regional Bell companies.\n",
            "Through interconnection pacts and the new wireless technology, AT&amp;T has said by 1998 it plans to offer local service to the vast majority of the U.S. population.\n",
            "MCI made an early move into local phone markets with its MCI Metro unit, but has appeared less aggresive than its peers since the passage of the U.S. Telecommunications Act of 1996 in evolving a strategy to expand its local phone presence.\n",
            "A key benefit of the merger with cash-rich British Telecom is the financing muscle that MCI can tap as MCI seeks to slice substantial market share away from the incumbent regional Bell telephone companies in various local service markets.\n",
            "MCI provides local service in 20 U.S. metropolitan markets through a mix of company-owned facilities and resale agreements to use other companies' networks. It has said it plans to be in 31 local service markets by the end of 1997.\n",

            "London telecoms analysts are split about the prospects of Britain's Cable and Wireless Communications, the telephone and television cable company that made its market debut on Monday.\n",
            "CWC started trading, as expected, at around 300 pence per share and rose to 309 pence before edging back to 299.5, valuing the group at around 4.46 billion pounds.\n",
            "CWC, which was formed last year when the Mercury subsidiary of Cable and Wireless Plc merged with the three cable TV units of NYNEX Corp and Bell Canada, floated a 14.7 percent stake in London and New York.\n",
            "Brokers Lehman Brothers says a 4.5 billion pound implies an enterprise value of about 6.0 billion pounds, assuming pro forma net debt at the end of 1996 at 1.5 billion stg. The valuation assumes a 700-800 million stg premium to the sum of the parts, assuming a valuation of Mercury of 2.0 billion pounds.\n",
            "\"The timing required to accomplish the technical integration of the various parts as well as the investments necessary to establish the new brand on a nation-wide basis suggest that at 4.5 billion stg, CWC assets are fairly valued.\"\n",
            "With 2.3 billion pounds of capital expenditure, CWC plans to complete its sophisticated broadband cable and local telephone networks and offer its services to six million customers by 2001.\n",
            "However, other analysts, such as Richard Jones at brokers Yamaichi and Andrew Harrington at Salomon Brothers, were more bullish.\n",
            "Jones is recommending buying the stock up to 350 pence per share. Harrington values the shares at 438p and the company at 6.5 billion pounds.\n",
            "Harrington argues that CWC's network cost structure has a competitive advantage against its main telephony and multi-channel television provider -- British Telecommunications Plc and satellite broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc.\n",
            "\"It's got 50 percent fewer employees per line than BT,\" he said. \"We think CWC has a unique competitive advantage in the provision of multi-channel TV and telephony. I think it's going to exceed expectations in the next year.\"\n",
            "CWC's core business will be the telephony provided by Mercury. Initially, 91 percent of revenues will come from telephony and only nine percent from entertainment, but it will be the first company to be able to bundle multi-channel television and telephony.\n",
            "Nevertheless, some analysts are cautious about the new company's prospects. Cable television companies have yet to make a profit in Britain's stagnant market.\n",
            "\"On a longer-term view, any valuation becomes almost entirely dependent on your view of what the longer-term penetration rate is going to be for telephony and cable TV,\" noted one analyst, who declined to be named.\n",
            "He said BT would move into broadcasting by 2001 at the latest, when current regulatory restrictions are lifted, and the group was likely to move into interactive services such as home shopping and home banking sooner.\n",
            "\"Put that alongside the impact of BT's on-going marketing muscle in basic telephony, combined with the impact of digital terrestrial TV and digital satellite TV, and I think that will all serve to put a brake on our expectations of long-term cable TV penetration,\" he said.\n",
            "Oliver Ehrenberg, telecoms analyst at Robert Fleming, says CWC is not worth more than 3.75 billion pounds -- and says his valuation is already stretched.\n",
            "But Harrington brushed aside these concerns, noting that BT's network will need a lot of investment to upgrade its telephone lines so they can support multi-channel TV and interactive services.\n",
            "\"Everything BT can do Cable and Wireless Communications can to better and sooner,\" he said.\n",

            "A crack anti-kidnap force, meanwhile, took up positions around the jail and a local police chief raised the possibility of launching a lightning operation to rescue the hostages.\n",
            "A group of 10 hardened convicts heading the revolt refused to budge on earlier demands for two helicopters to airlift them out of the jail in Valledupar, in Cesar province, and take them to an undisclosed location, the city mayor said.\n",
            "At least one of the men, a former leader of the now-defunct M-19 leftist rebel movement, called for political asylum in Cuba.\n",
            "\"I would urge the prisoners to be patient and avoid any further bloodshed. We are on our way to the jail (from Bogota) and want to look for a peaceful solution to this grave problem,\" said government human rights ombudsman Jose Fernando Castro, who is heading the mediation team.\n",
            "About 550 inmates went on a rampage on Thursday evening and seized control of the jail after overpowering 18 guards and confiscating their pistols and nightsticks. Police said leftist guerrillas and four former policemen jailed for kidnapping and extortion are heading the disturbance.\n",
            "A spokeswoman for the National Prisons Institute originally said five guards were reported killed in the shoot-out and a handful of convicts had been injured. By Friday morning, Valledupar mayor Tito Pumarejo confirmed that four bodies, all prison guards, had been ferried out of the jail compound by Red Cross workers.\n",
            "The INPEC spokeswoman said the final death toll may be higher, adding that security forces were still unable to enter the jail.\n",
            "A Valledupar police commander, Col. Alvaro Becerra, said about 100 police and troops had formed three security cordons around the jail and said there was a \"tense but calm stand-off.\"\n",
            "\"It would be difficult to mount an operation to rescue the hostages. It would require a great deal of planning. But an elite GAULA (anti-kidnap) squad is in place and a combined police and army strike is a possibility,\" he told Reuters by phone.\n",
            "\"But the inmates' demands are absolutely absurd and I don't think they will be granted,\" he added.\n",
            "The inmates are holding at least 15 hostages, including a 14-year-old girl who was visiting the jail when the riot erupted, and the prison's deputy director. The majority of the prisoners restricted their demands to an end to overcrowding and better conditions.\n",
            "The riot in Valledupar jail, built for 200 inmates and not the current 550 it houses, is the latest in a series of disturbances in Colombian jails.\n",
            "Three provincial prisons were rocked by riots earlier this year. In the last 10 days, 2,000 inmates, led by convicted guerrillas, smashed part of Bogota's La Modelo jail while an inmate died in Bogota's top-security La Picota facility when a bomb he was making in his cell accidentally exploded.\n",
            "Chronic overcrowding is broadly considered to be the main cause of the riots. More than 40,000 prisoners are crammed into facilities designed for 30,000 people, the INPEC spokeswoman said.\n",

            "The legal barrage by Netscape Communications Corp. against arch-rival Microsoft Corp. may end up dampening investors' enthusiasm for both stocks, analysts said on Wednesday.\n",
            "Gary Reback, Netscape's outside counsel at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, has urged the Department of Justice to take immediate action against Microsoft for alleged violations of its 1994 consent decree and antitrust laws.\n",
            "Separately, Tim O'Reilly, head of Internet publisher O'Reilly &amp; Associates, said he was recently approached by a Justice Department official asking about Microsoft's behaviour, perhaps indicating fresh interest in the matter.\n",
            "Microsoft, which has weathered legal battles successfully in the past, has rebuffed the allegations, saying Netscape's claims are \"full of wild and unsubstantiated statements.\"\n",
            "The software giant went on the offensive Wednesday, accusing Netscape of failing to live up to its own promises that it would support open Internet standards.\n",
            "\"Netscape should take a good look at themselves in the mirror,\" said Brad Chase, vice president or marketing for Microsoft's Internet division, noting Netscape had blocked users of Microsoft's browser from parts of the Netscape site.\n",
            "Nevertheless, analysts noted the market has a distaste for legal uncertainty, and investors were likely to start factoring in at least some degree of risk that the battle could escalate into a full-fledged government investigation or lawsuit.\n",
            "\"The legal risk is starting to get heightened on this,\" said Montgomery Securities analyst David Readerman, who covered Microsoft during Apple Computer Inc.'s failed five-year copyright lawsuit against the software giant.\n",
            "Microsoft also was probed by the Federal Trade Commission and, subsequently, the Justice Department for five years until its July 1994 signing of a consent decree agreeing to alter the way it licenses operating system software.\n",
            "That accord was viewed by some of its software rivals as having been lenient, and Netscape's lawyer asked the Justice Department in a letter released Tuesday to examine whether Microsoft was now using its control over computer operating systems improperly.\n",
            "In both cases, analysts noted that the hint of further legal difficulties could dampen further advances in the companies' stocks as the market seeks to sort out the business impact, if any.\n",
            "\"We've been there with the Apple vs Microsoft and we've been there with the (Justice Department) and the experience is that these stocks tend to stall as the market tries to figure out what the risk is all about,\" said Readerman.\n",
            "Microsoft stock closed up 12.5 cents at $123.50, while Netscape was unchanged at $37.25, both on Nasdaq.\n",
            "Lawyers in Washington, D.C., said they doubt the Justice Department would find Microsoft had acted improperly, based on the charges leveled against the company by Netscape.\n",
            "Mountain View, Calif.-based Netscape alleged through its letter to the DOJ that Microsoft had offered \"clandestine side payments\" and discounts on its operating system, and other inducements, to promote use of its own Internet browser.\n",
            "The lawyers contacted by Reuters noted that while Microsoft dominates the PC operating system market with around a 90 percent share, Netscape has an estimated 80 percent share of the market for Internet browser software.\n",

            "\"This relationship will ensure that things run smoothly. Without a good relationship, things can take years to get processed, and years of hold up for a 4 million ounce a year producer is very, very costly,\" Walsh told Reuters.\n",
            "Vancouver-based gold miner Placer Dome Inc. said Wednesday its $5 billion offer to merge with Bre-X made before Monday's agreement was no longer feasible because Bre-X was now worth less. But Placer said it remained interested in the project and would like to hold talks with Bre-X.\n",
            "Walsh said Bre-X would inform the Indonesian government if it agreed to a merger or sale of its Busang stake. But asked if a deal required government approval, Walsh replied: \"No.\"\n",
            "Walsh added that Bre-X's Busang partners did not have rights of first refusal if Bre-X received a third-party offer.\n",
            "He said the Indonesian government indicated it would process contracts of work, known as COWS, for the Busang site as early as possible. \"I do know the government has a wish to process these very, very quickly. So I would not think that we would have to wait very long,\" said Walsh.\n",
            "A feasibility study of the project should be completed later in 1997, with construction of the mine expected to begin in 1998. Capital expenditure is estimated at about $1.5 billion.\n",
            "Production was expected to begin in 2000 at a rate of two million ounces annually and climb to four million ounces a year in 2002, said John Felderhoff, Bre-X's senior vice-president of exploration.\n",
            "Bre-X's latest estimate for the Busang Two area was about 71 million ounces of gold, but Felderhoff said it could be much higher. \"If you would ask me what is the total potential, I would feel very comfortable with 200 million ounces,\" he said.\n",
            "Bre-X's financial adviser, J.P. Morgan and Co. Inc., said Wednesday it would provide a fairness opinion on the agreement. \"We're very confident it provides very good value to the shareholders of Bre-X,\" said J.P. Morgan's Leslie Morrison, who is advising Bre-X on the deal.\n",
            "Canadian newspapers reported Wednesday that Indonesian businessman Jusuf Merukh alleged that the deal with Freeport and the Indonesian interests was illegal and asked Indonesian President Suharto to cancel it.\n",
            "Merukh is suing Bre-X for $2 billion in a Canadian court, alleging that his company was entitled to 30 percent of Busang. Bre-X has filed a motion to dismiss the suit. Bre-X topped Toronto Stock Exchange actives Wednesday, gaining C70 cents to C$21.50 on 7.7 million shares after falling sharply Monday and Tuesday on news of the deal.\n",

            "Anglo-U.S. drugs group SmithKline Beecham Plc said on Tuesday that it expected anti-depressent Paxil/Seroxat to take over as its best-selling drug by the end of this year.\n",
            "In a telephone interview with Reuters finance director Hugh Collum said it was probable that Paxil/Seroxat \"will be the biggest selling product by the end of this year.\"Sales of the drug, which competes with Eli Lilly &amp; Co's Prozac, jumped 42 percent last year to 706 million stg, gaining ground on SmithKline's current top seller, antibiotic Augmentin.  \n",
            "\"The added indication of panic disorder gives us added uniqueness\" in comparison with Prozac, said Collum. Although he declined to give sales targets for Paxil, he said \"we are very optimistic\" and noted that Prozac sales were in excess of $2 billion a year.\n",
            "The finance director also highlighted the Havrix hepatitis A vaccine, Hycamtin for ovarian cancer and anti-emetic Kytril as potential strong growth products looking ahead, together with combination vaccines like Infanrix.  \n",
            "SmithKline does not expect drugs to flow from its DNA research link with Human Genome Sciences (HGS) until after the turn of the century, Collum said. But he noted the licensing arrangements on DNA-based drugs already in place with major competitors including Merck &amp; Co and Schering-Plough Corp and added \"we are very optimistic. Looking back I think it was a very good investment decision.\"\n",
            "Collum said he was \"really very pleased\" at the reduction in the group's stubbornly high debt levels, which came down to 1.64 billion stg at the end of 1996 from around 1.8 billion at the start of the year.  \n",
            "However, he said that with capital expenditure expected to total around 550 million stg this year, debt levels would only \"come down a bit\" in 1997.\n",
            "He said operating margins would continue to be affected by high research and development spending and marketing costs related to over-the-counter products.\n",
            "Collum said he hoped the Clinical Laboratories operation, which has been hit by changes in U.S. reimbursement rules for diagnostic tests, was \"back on track.\"\n",
            "\"We hope so. On the other hand there are still pressures on it. It is the third biggest in the U.S, we have a good geographical spread but it is still difficult,\" Collum said.\n",

            "The Explorer from Ford Motor Co., one of the brightest stars in the sport utility segment, looks headed to its first ever sales incentives.\n",
            "Explorer, the best-selling four-door vehicle in the country for nearly two years, is facing its stiffest competition since it was introduced six years ago.\n",
            "Ironically, some of that will come from the new Expedition full-sized sport utility that Ford is now introducing. The Explorer is also battling subsidised leases on competitive models that have made Chrysler Corp. Cherokees available for as little as $199 a month.\n",
            "\"We expect by the end of the year, they will most likely have begun some type of national programme on the Explorer,\" said Wesley Brown, director of global product analysis at CSM Forecasting, a consultant in Farmington Hills, Mich.\n",
            "In a research report published earlier this week, Salomon Brothers analyst Jack Kirnan predicted Ford will launch lease incentives and other marketing support on the Explorer in the next 60 days.\n",
            "\"We strongly suspect that the all-new Expedition full-size sport utility will begin to cannibalize some sales from the Explorer, which alone should force Ford to implement incentives on the vehicle,\" said Kirnan.\n",
            "Ford executives have said the Expedition, based on a modified platform of the new F-150 pickup truck, will steal 10 percent to 15 percent of the smaller Explorer's sales. Analysts believe Ford's internal projections have underestimated the Expedition's effects.\n",
            "Explorer sales are already being hurt by the new Mercury Mountaineer, which is taking production capacity away from its sister Ford Division vehicle.\n",
            "Including sales from August announced Thursday, Explorer sales have dropped five months in a row. For the month, sales were 27,615, down 10.7 percent. So far this year, sales of the sport utility were 264,996, 3.5 percent ahead of 1995.\n",
            "Ford did not act as it were worried about hurting sales when it priced the 1997 Explorer. After quietly raising prices $200 at the end of the 1996 model year, Ford boosted the price for most Explorers another $315, one of the steepest in the model line. Going along with the price hikes, however, are some improved equipment features for the 1997 model year.\n",
            "Jim Bright, a Ford Division spokesman, declined to discuss the possibilty of Explorer incentives. He noted the Explorer has faced tough competition before.\n",
            "\"We've never had a penny of incentive money on Explorer,\" he said. \"People keep coming after us. To date, we have not had to take that action.\"\n",

            "The automaker is building a 35,000-square-foot historical museum on the grounds of its corporate headquarters and technical center here to house vintage vehicles, company archives and a theater.\n",
            "The project will be the first full-fledged company-owned museum among Detroit's Big Three automakers. German automakers Mercedes-Benz AG and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG have museums in their respective home cities of Stuttgart and Munich that have become major tourist attractions.\n",
            "Eaton said the Chrysler Historical Museum also will eventually open to the public, but added that it also is intended to instill pride in the company's employees.\n",
            "The project is another sign of Chrysler's confidence in its future and of the dramatic shift in the automaker's fortunes since its brushes with financial ruin in 1980 and again in 1991.\n",
            "The automaker nearly sold its collection of vintage vehicles -- including the very first 1924 Chrysler Six touring car -- in the late 1970s to raise cash.\n",
            "\"Five years ago, we wouldn't have been talking about being able to afford this,\" Eaton said.\n",
            "But he insisted that the museum was not corporate largesse brought on by Chrysler's financial success this year and does not expect any backlash from shareholders.\n",
            "\"I don't think there would ever be anybody who would ask that question when you consider the amount we've invested in in new products and in the shareholders, etcetera.\"\n",

            "Canada's TrizecHahn Corp and German businessman Dieter Bock on Wednesday unveiled a European property alliance which analysts said underlined increasing confidence in the market.\n",
            "\"This shows further faith being expressed in the UK and European property market,\" a property analyst at one major European investment bank said.\n",
            "Toronto-based TrizecHahn, which has $6.0 billion in assets and $1.2 billion in uncommitted capital, said it would buy British and German property projects from Bock's Advanta Management AG for around $147 million.\n",
            "It said it would pay for the acquisitions by issuing subordinate voting shares to Bock, as well as by assuming development liabilities and through construction financing.\n",
            "Steve Mallen, head of research at property consultants Knight Frank, praised the timing of the move, saying: \"This is a wise strategic move, I think their timing is perfect.\"\n",
            "Bock will become president of TrizecHahn Europe and a director of the company, with an equity stake of around four percent. At the same time Bock announced he would resign as non-executive deputy chairman of Lonrho Plc and also as a director of the British- based trading and hotels conglomerate.\n",
            "\"The opportunity at TrizecHahn will demand my full attention,\" Bock said.\n",
            "Both parties said the partnership represented an important strategic move, reflecting its commitment to expanding outside North America. Under the terms of the deal, which is expected to close in April, TrizecHahn's existing European operations will be merged with its new German and British development projects under Bock's leadership.\n",
            "Peter Munk, TrizecHahn's chairman and chief executive, told a telephone news conference he was excited by the deal, which would allow the marriage of the firm's asset base and experience with Bock's \"experience, presence and credibility\" in Europe.\n",
            "Munk said the deal would widen TrizecHahn's horizons beyond Eastern Europe to the whole of the European market. He said the company's involvement would encompass both development and investment in property in Europe.\n",
            "He had not done business with Bock before, he said, but the two had become good friends out of a common interest in gold mining.\n",
            "Bock said he was bringing in expertise built up in Europe and would strengthen the European management capacity.\n",
            "The projects being taken over by TrizecHahn were a commercial property, Number 1 Poultry in London's City financial district, two commercial developments in Berlin, one in Dresden and a Baltic Sea project.\n",

            "France's restructuring of its defence sector and the key role of state-owned Aerospatiale in that process are complicating the change in the European Airbus consortium into a limited liability company, analysts said.\n",
            "The four national firms in Airbus Industrie are studying the best way to convert the partnership into a faster, more efficient company, better to compete with U.S. rival Boeing Co, which is merging with McDonnell Douglas.\n",
            "Aerospatiale is not only the French partner in the Airbus passenger plane venture but is also involved in the two deals at the heart of France's defence industry consolidation -- the merger of Aerospatiale and combat plane maker Dassault Aviation and the privatisation of electronics firm Thomson-CSF .\n",
            "\"It is consistent with French strategic thinking that you must first get your house in order, then negotiate from a position of strength,\" said an industry executive.\n",
            "\"Aerospatiale cannot do this today in the Airbus system. It has to have weight behind it. It will have that weight when the Dassault merger is complete,\" he added. DASSAULT MERGER WILL BOOST AEROSPATIALE\n",
            "The Dassault merger, due to be agreed this year, will add 13 billion francs of annual turnover to Aerospatiale, creating a group with combined sales of 64 billion and giving Aerospatiale greater clout at the Airbus negotiating table.\n",
            "A banker close to the Airbus talks said Aerospatiale is seen as the weakest among the senior Airbus partners -- British Aerospace (BAe) and Daimler-Benz Aerospace (Dasa). Casa of Spain makes up the fourth Airbus partner.\n",
            "But Aerospatiale will get an injection of aggressive, private-sector management with the Dassault merger.\n",
            "Aerospatiale executives complain bitterly that the foreign media does not give them due credit for their industrial restructuring. Their efforts turned the company round to post a 1996 net attributable profit of 812 million francs, after years of losses, and racked up sales of 51 billion francs.\n",
            "Their exasperation is palpable when they say their public sector tag is seen as a weakness when compared to the private sector BAe and Dasa.\n",
            "But analysts point out that Aerospatiale was slower in attacking its cost structure and still needs to improve.\n",
            "BAe underwent drastic pruning in the early 1990s, going from an empire with property, cars and military interests to a group focused on defence and aerospace. It posted 1996 pretax profits of 425 million pounds, on sales of 7.44 billion pounds.\n",
            "Dasa, although loss-making, has the industrial and financial strength of parent Daimler-Benz AG which has set a management target of a 12 percent return on capital. Dasa posted 1996 turnover of 13 billion marks, making it smaller than BAe and Aerospatiale, but it has huge ambitions for Airbus.\n",
            "A business consultant said Aerospatiale has excellent programmes, but, using benchmarking techniques, its military projects are 30 percent more costly than those of BAe and Dasa. THOMSON-CSF SALE ENHANCES PROSPECTS\n",
            "Apart from the Dassault merger, Aerospatiale also holds a key hand in the Thomson-CSF sell-off.\n",
            "The government has said bidders Alcatel Alsthom and Lagardere will have to take into account Aerospatiale's interests when putting together their offers for Thomson-CSF.\n",
            "Even though Aerospatiale, as a state-controlled company, cannot take part direcly in the privatisation, it will be affected by the outcome and chairman Yves Michot will give his views to the government on the rival bids.\n",
            "French newspapers have reported that Michot will have to observe strict neutrality in the contest. But it is clear Alcatel's plans would significantly strengthen Aerospatiale, giving it still greater weight against BAe and Dasa.\n",
            "If Alcatel won Thomson-CSF, it would create a missiles joint venture between Thomson-CSF and Aerospatiale, and a satellite venture between Alcatel Espace, Aerospatiale and Thomson-CSF.\n",
            "Lagardere has said it wants a dialogue with Aerospatiale to prepare its bid. Relations between the two firms have been strained as they compete in missiles and satellites.\n",
            "\"The perimeter of Aerospatiale is not yet defined,\" said the industry executive.\n",
            "The government plans to decide on the Thomson-CSF bids by June 30. AEROSPATIALE NEEDS AIRBUS, WILL MAKE IT WORK\n",
            "Aerospatiale only stands to gain from the defence moves and is in no hurry to bow to pressures from BAe and Dasa to rush into an Airbus agreement which does not suit its own interests.\n",
            "Airbus is vitally important for Aerospatiale. Its 38 percent stake in Airbus contributed the biggest slice of 1996 operating profit, 1.175 billion francs, and around 70 percent of sales.\n",
            "Analysts believe of the big Airbus three, Aerospatiale needs Airbus the most, and BAe and Dasa could, in extremis, walk away if relations broke down irreparably.\n",
            "BAe has a 20 percent Airbus stake and has bigger military interests, while Dasa's parent Daimler-Benz gets most of its money from the auto business, through Mercedes trucks and cars.\n",
            "Aerospatiale has, paradoxically, maximalist and minimalist aims for the new Airbus company.\n",
            "For the near term, Michot takes a cautious approach in the status change, arguing that the present system has proven its worth, winning Airbus a third of the world market, coming out of nowhere in 25 years. A much bigger manufacturing concern would overstretch the management.\n",
            "In the long term however, Michot would like Airbus to have a military wing, to balance out economic cycles with government contracts. U.S. giant Lockheed Martin has both civil and defence sides, and Boeing will acquire McDonnell's significant military interests in the pending merger.\n",
            "The Airbus partners said in January they agreed in principle on the change to a single integrated company, in which the new Airbus would own its factories and design offices. Work is going on this year on valuing the assets to be vested in the new firm.\n",
            "That valuation is complicated as some of the factories mix civil and military programmes, and some plants are efficient while others are uncompetitive. In BAe's case this is made easy as it has a plant for making Airbus wings, and Dasa has a special production line near Hamburg for the Airbus 320 family.\n",
            "One way of viewing the Airbus negotiations is through the prism of conflicting cultural visions.\n",
            "\"This country (France) has a vision of long-term industrial strategy. It wants to be a world power and be a dominant player in the aircraft industry,\" said the industry executive. Without that vision, Airbus arguably would never have got funds to launch its first plane in the early 1970s.\n",
            "Set against that long-term strategic view, is the British insistence on short-term returns for shareholders, summed up as \"Let the City decide\".\n",
            "But Aerospatiale would not have signed the agreement on the Airbus change if it had not meant it, the executive said.\n",

            "The conditions are: he wants the banks to approve the restructuring deal before the shareholders give their approval, both tunnel bores to be operating by May 15, freight service on the Shuttle to be resumed before June 15 and an extension of the tunnel concession by the French and British governments.\n",

            "Sing Tao Holdings Ltd, facing a probe by graft-busters at its Hongkong Standard Newspapers Ltd unit, could see a drop in advertising revenues at its English-language papers, media analysts said on Thursday.\n",
            "\"Advertising will be affected, of course. People look at the circulation when they decide to place ads,\" said Ben Kwong, research director at Dharmala Securities.\n",
            "Hongkong Standard Newspapers, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sing Tao, publishes the English-language Hongkong Standard and Sunday Standard newspapers.\n",
            "\"Advertisers will probably withhold or be hesitant until they have clarification from the company as to what exactly their circulation was,\" another analyst said.\n",
            "Hong Kong's graft watchdog, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), said it raided the Hongkong Standard offices on Wednesday as part of an investigation into fraudulent inflation of circulation figures.\n",
            "The ICAC also arrested four current employees and two former staff members.\n",
            "The ICAC said its investigations had \"revealed a scheme which involved the deliberate excess printing of over 10,000 extra copies of the newspapers each day which were purportedly sold to a bogus bulk distributor\".\n",
            "The surplus was actually sold as waste paper, it said in a statement on Wednesday.\n",
            "\"ICAC inquiries also indicated that more recently the deliberately printed surplus and systematic disposal has ranged from 14,000 up to 23,000 copies per day,\" it said.\n",
            "A Sing Tao official told Reuters the company would not make any comment while the investigations were continuing.\n",
            "Trading in Sing Tao shares resumed on Thursday after a one-day suspension. The shares closed HK$0.075 lower at HK$2.90.\n",
            "Analysts said that while Sing Tao shares would come under some pressure due to the probe at its Hongkong Standard Newspapers unit, the publishing group was not expected to suffer deep cuts to its bottom line as the English-language papers had not brought in much profit in past years.\n",
            "On Thursday, Sing Tao published an announcement reprinting the ICAC statement and gave results for the group.\n",
            "\"The results of Hongkong Standard for the year ended 31 March, 1996, showed an operating loss in excess of the operating loss of approximately HK$11.7 million (US$1.51 million) incurred by the group in newspaper publishing in that year,\" the announcement said.\n",
            "It gave no breakdown of the losses.\n",

            "The ICAC probe is not the first time the Sing Tao group has made news in Hong Kong.\n",
            "In May, rumours swept the stock market that chairman Sally Aw was in talks to sell all or part of her 68 percent holding in the group to a Malaysian party. Aw denied the rumours.\n",

            "Thomson-CSF reported net attributable profit of 745 million francs ($129 million) compared with a net loss of 791 million for 1995. Sales were up 2.2 percent at 36.27 billion.\n",

            "Thomson-CSF said in a statement that operating profit rose 5.6 percent to 2.07 billion francs despite a reduction in military budgets and tougher markets. The improvement was due to better competitiveness following restructuring efforts pursued over a number of years.\n",
            "The net result was dented by an exceptional charge of 824 million francs, compared with 753 million in the prior year, to cover restructuring costs tied to the shrinking of markets and cost-cutting measures, it said.\n",
            "Pre-tax pre-exceptional profit rose 12 percent to 2.04 billion francs, reflecting the productivity gains and lower financial charges. Financial costs fell to 27 million francs from 135 million, due to lower interest rates and favourable currency movements.\n",
            "Consolidated pretax profit was 1.30 billion francs, versus a loss of 437 million, which included a 101 million franc hit from its the sale of its holding in the troubled state-owned bank Credit Lyonnais.\n",
            "Thomson-CSF's previous three years' losses were essentially due to falls in the value of Credit Lyonnais' shares, which were taken on Thomson-CSF's accounts to reflect its equity stake.\n",

            "Under the terms of the deal, which received Beijing's blessing on Thursday, British-controlled Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd no longer leads the consortium, which has been renamed Asia Container Terminals Ltd (ACT).\n",
            "ACT, formerly the Tsingyi Consortium, would swap the two berths in CT9 originally awarded for two existing berths in the existing Container Terminal Eight (CT8) currently operated by Modern Terminals Ltd (MTL), a unit of Wharf (Holdings) Ltd\n",

            "MTL would build three of the four berths at CT9, while Hong Kong International Terminals Ltd (HIT), a a unit of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd, would build one berth.\n",
            "Both HIT and MTL would also have one smaller feeder berth each at CT9, officials said.\n",
            "The contract to develop CT9, which will have an annual capacity of 2.2 million 20-foot equivalent units (TEU) upon completion, was awarded by the Hong Kong government in 1992 to the consortium by private treaty grant.\n",
            "Tsingyi was originally allocated two berths. Existing container terminal operators, HIT and MTL, were awarded development rights to one berth each.\n",
            "Beijing, citing the lack of an open tender, had refused to approve the project as required because it straddles Hong Kong's 1997 handover to China.\n",
            "Beijing had accused the Hong Kong government of rewarding Jardine, a pillar of the British establishment since the colony was founded, for supporting Governor Chris Patten's electoral reforms, themselves the object of bitter Chinese opposition.\n",

            "The deal was announced two days after Milwaukee-based bank holding company Marshall &amp; Ilsley Corp. said it would acquire cross-town thrift Security Capital Corp. for about $945 million in cash and stock, or about $92 a share.\n",
            "Both deals help the buyer increase market share in the consolidating Midwest banking arena. Marshall &amp; Ilsley said it will increase its market share to 19.2 percent in Wisconsin, with Milwaukee-based Firstar Corp., the number two bank in the state, at 12.1 percent of deposits.\n",
            "At the same time, the acquisition of $2.4 billion asset Standard Financial and its 14 full-service offices would strengthen TCF's franchise in Chicago, allowing it to do more cost affective advertising than it could before the deal, William Cooper, chairman of $7.1 billion asset TCF said.\n",
            "\"We believe this merger will produce long-term revenue enhancements and meaningful cost savings,\" Cooper said in a news release.\n",
            "TCF expects to save about $4 million annually once the two banks' operations are combined in Illinois and to generate more than $4 million in revenues from the deal by offering more products to Standard Financial customers, changing the mix of Standard Financial's loan portfolio to add higher yielding loans and through fees at its automatic teller machines.\n",
            "\"Standard certainly has the customer profile TCF looks for, but I thought the price that they paid was fairly rich based on Standard's earnings,\" Stephen Skiba, analyst at ABN AMRO Chicago Corp, said.\n",
            "The combined company would have $10 billion in assets and 276 financial services offices and more than 900 automatic teller machines in five Midwest states.\n",
            "TCF, a savings bank holding company based in Minneapolis, will offer about $25 for each Standard share. Standard stockholders may choose to receive cash or TCF shares or a combination of the two. Between 40 percent and 60 percent of the purchase would be paid in TCF stock, and the rest in cash.\n",
            "The exchange ratio for shares would depend on the average price of TCF stock during the 30 trading days before the deal closes.\n",
            "Analysts also thought Marshall &amp; Ilsley paid a full price for Security Capital, a $3.66 billion asset thrift with 42 bank branches and 10 lending offices throughout Wisconsin.\n",
            "The $92 a share acquisition price includes about 12.3 million Marshall &amp; Ilsley common shares and $376 million in cash and is a premium over the $84.75 closing price for Security Capital Friday.\n",
            "\"It's pretty pricey,\" said Thomas Maier, analyst at EVEREN Securities. \"You can argue that given what it does for them in terms of share in the state of Wisconsin, it's worth it.\"\n",
            "Wisconsin is seen as one target area for Midwest regional banks to make acqusitions to enhance market share.\n",
            "\"I think it's a defensive move on M&amp;I's part, that if they didn't grow within the Wisconsin market, it was more likely they would be a takeover target,\" Skiba said.\n",
            "Skiba also said the acquisition of Standard Financial by TCF could make other Chicago-area thrifts, including MAF Bancorp Inc. and St. Paul Bancorp Inc., even more likely acquisition targets.\n",

            "A 90-cent increase in the U.S. minimum wage will have little short-term impact on most fast food restaurants, since the competition for workers is keeping pay rates above the federally mandated standard.\n",
            "\"The (real) 'minimum wage' is what the closest McDonald's pays or it could be the local Pizza Hut,\" George Goulson, senior vice president of A&amp;W Restaurants Inc, said.\n",
            "But longer term, the industry fears that workers, who are already making more than the new minimum wage, will be looking for a raise to maintain the pay premium.  \n",
            "Earlier Tuesday, President Clinton signed into law the first rise in the minimum wage in five years, boosting the wage to $5.15 an hour from $4.25.\n",
            "\"Our average crew wage is about $5.20 (an hour) so short-term there is not going to be any impact,\" said Denny Lynch, spokesman for Wendy's International Inc, which operates 4,307 restaurants in the United States.\n",
            "But higher minimum wages will raise total wages by about $500,000 over the next 12 months at American Restaurant Partners L.P., which operates 62 Pizza Hut restaurant franchises.  \n",
            "\"If you raise someone who started in the last two months (to the new minimum wage level), you also have to raise everybody else,\" said Terry Freund, chief financial officer of American Restaurant Partners.\n",
            "Beyond the minimum wage requirements, competition for workers, from cooks to delivery drivers, has forced many fast-food chains to pay up to hire good help, particularly in metropolitan markets. That competition is being driven by an increase in restaurant openings.\n",
            "\"There are neighborhoods where we have to pay $6.00 an hour to $6.50 or $7.00 to get\" good workers, Lynch added.  \n",
            "Fast-food industry executives said there has been competition for workers since the late 1980s, although the increase in restaurant openings is making the search for employees more intense.\n",
            "Another problem for quick-service restaurants is that wage competition from other employers often lures experienced workers away. A fast-food worker, for example, may be able to bring home more pay as a waiter or waitress at a casual dining establishment where they could receive $50 or $60 a night in tips, executives said.\n",

            "The sale, which still needs approval from the independent Privatisation Commission, will be preceded by a state capital injection of up to 1.2 billion francs ($229 million).\n",
            "The Societe Francaise de Production et de Creation Audiovisuelle (SFP) will get 350 million francs of this amount before the end of 1996.\n",
            "In a joint statement, the Culture Ministry and the Ministry of Economy and Finance said Culture Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy had met European Commissioner Karel van Miert in Brussels on Monday to discuss the planned capital injection.\n",
            "\"He (Van Miert) accepted the principle of a very quick opening of the examination procedure which would allow the European Commission to approve, in principle before the spring, the state's financial effort in the privatisation framework.\"\n",
            "It said that the cash injection was needed because of the financial and economic situation of the SFP and would allow the future shareholders to run the normal operating risks and contribute 40 percent to the costs of a job reduction plan.\n",
            "There had been four offers for SFP on the table. One was by Global Studios run by French businessman Walter Butler, another by Little Big One (LBO) run by Swiss investor Frabrice Giger and a third by former SFP director Jean Cressant.\n",
            "The fourth was made by Havas' Images Television International and Generale des Eaux's Generale des Images.\n",
            "All the bids were demanding a state capital injection in exchange for maintaining jobs.\n",
            "The Havas/Generale des Eaux plan contained 480 job cuts out of the 1,010 SFP staff. LBO promised to keep as many as 700 jobs while Walter Butler would have kept 580.\n",
            "Generale des Eaux, which also owns the Babelsberg studios in Germany, had previously backed the Butler bid.\n",
            "The European Commission had previously objected to the 1.1 billion franc in aid given to SFP between 1993 and 1996.\n",
            "The SFP studios were created on the grounds of the Buttes Chaumont villa of French film pioneer Leon Gaumont in north Paris and its later facilities in Boulogne-Billancourt and modern site at Bry-sur-Marne are the backdrop of many French films and television series.\n",

            "Cable and Wireless Communications (CWC), Britain's biggest and newest cable telephone and television group will float a 14.7 percent stake in London and New York early next week.\n",
            "The flotation, which is not big enough to propel the new company into the FTSE, has been expected since CWC was formed in 1996 by merging the Mercury unit of Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc with the three British cable TV units of NYNEX Corp and Bell Canada.\n",
            "The recommended offer for shares in CWC, which has been valued by analysts at an average of around 4.5 billion pounds ($7.3 billion), closed on Friday at 1330 GMT and experts expect trading to start on Monday at 1330 GMT.\n",
            "No confirmation of the level of acceptances was expected before 1600 GMT, but the offer was recommended and over 65 percent of shareholders accepted the deal when CWC's complex prospectus was issued in March.\n",
            "Richard Brown, the incoming chairman of CWC and chief executive of Cable and Wireless, says the company will be customer-led and market-driven and has promised a flotation immediately after the offer closes.\n",
            "After the merger, there will be only one brand name  -- Cable and Wireless -- and a huge advertising campaign is planned ensure the name wins public recognition.\n",
            "With assets worth about 4.5 billion pounds, CWC will provide a broad range of local, national and international voice and data services and, in some regions, multichannel TV and internet computer services.\n",
            "Despite bringing together cable TV groups NYNEX CableComms, Bell Cablemedia Plc and Videotron, CWC's core business will be the telephony provided by Mercury. It will be British Telecommunications's main rival.\n",
            "But with initially only 1.1 million residential telecom and 80,000 business customers compared to BT's 20.5 million residential and about seven million business clients, some analysts say the new company will only pose a serious threat to BT in the middle of the next Century.\n",
            "\"I don't see CWC as a threat (to BT) in the short and medium term,\" said Oliver Ehrenberg, telecoms anlayst at Robert Flemming.\n",
            "Initially, around 91 percent of revenues will be derived from telecoms and only nine percent from TV entertainment, although this is expected to grow.\n",
            "The company hopes to be the first to roll out its 200-channel service ahead of its rivals, which include satellite broadcaster BSkyB, possibly by autumn.\n",
            "CWC plans to complete its broadband cable and local telephony networks by investing some 110 million pounds over two years and offer services to more than six million residential customers by 2001.\n",
            "It also wants to serve almost all small and medium-sized businesses within its 45 cable franchise areas.\n",
            "Another 180 million pounds will be spent over the same period on so-called set top boxes, with which customers can receive multi-channel television services.\n",
            "But with 2.3 billion pounds of capital expenditure in the first two years and initial net debt of 1.3 billion pounds, Ehrenberg does not expect investors to receive a dividend before 2001 at the earliest.\n",
            "Cable and Wireless, which will have a 52.6 percent stake in CWC, wants to remain a majority shareholder and has said it will consider boosting its investment if partners back out.\n",
            "NYNEX and Bell Canada, which are facing increasing competition at home, have not so far seen great returns for their investments in Britain's stagnant cable market.\n",

            "Britain's double-decker bus could be at the cutting edge of an environmental breakthrough.\n",
            "For the past two years a London bus operator has carried out experiments with an Arab inventor who says he has the solution to the black diesel-based pollution fumes that led Britain's air quality levels to break world safety standards last summer.\n",
            "Hassan Assali linked up with the London and Liverpool bus company Merseyside Transport Ltd (MTL) in a two-year experiment to test his invention -- an oil recycler which he told Reuters cuts pollution levels by 50 percent and saves on lubricating oil by recycling it six to 10 times.\n",
            "\"Last summer there was big talk about stopping vehicles entering towns altogether as pollution levels were going through the roof.\n",
            "\"With this,\" said Assali cradling his recycler at his West London headquarters, \"we can cut the amount of oil used and dumped, cut pollution levels, plus save money.\"\n",
            "The recycler, invented by Assali who is managing director of the company behind it called Pinmore, has taken six years to develop and millions of pounds (dollars) of investment funded by an anonymous Palestinian backer.\n",
            "The Pinmore recycler prototype was made by a gunsmith in London's East End because: \"It was the only way we could get the precision we needed,\" said Assali.\n",
            "MADE IN CHINA\n",
            "It is now being manufactured in China's Huzhan province and has sold 6,000 units at a cost of 250 pounds ($425.2) each.\n",
            "Customers to date include an Algerian bus company which has ordered 3,000 recyclers and Saudi Arabia's frontier guards who bought 1,000 for their trucks -- \"They're constantly plagued by desert sand getting into the oil,\" added the inventor.\n",
            "In November Assali held a conference in Oxford, England attended by more than 40 delegates from the transport industry, including bus companies.\n",
            "At the conference MTL publicly endorsed the recycler after two years of tests on its oldest London buses. Professor Gordon Andrews of the fuel and energy department at Leeds University and a consultant to the motor industry, also agreed it worked.\n",
            "Phil Locke, systems manager for group engineering at MTL, told Reuters: \"We've had a lot of success and it's given us tremendous savings. It's also given us smaller fuel emmissions, which are down sharply.\"\n",
            "He said the bus group's initial scepticism had vanished and it is now considering buying up to 2,000 recyclers for its fleet in London and Liverpool.\n",
            "\"We've had so many people approach us in the past with different systems and they say it works. But most don't. We took a gamble on Mr Assali and it's working,\" said Locke.\n",
            "\"I think it's been looked at by enough people and they see the benefits -- it has the chance of turning into a big thing.\"\n",
            "The reception from motor manufacturers like Nissan has been cooler, says Assali, despite the pressing environmental and health arguments to cut pollution.\n",
            "Assali also says two major oil companies have called him to rubbish his work out of hand. \"I was afraid they would send a hit-man,\" he joked.\n",
            "But he says the evidence is in his favour. Pinmore carried out experiments for two years in north London with MTL.\n",
            "RECYCLING BUS\n",
            "The experiment fitted one bus with a recycler and one without, said Assali. \"We said to the client \"Run these buses in the worst conditions possible - stopping, starting continuously and braking suddenly'.\"\n",
            "He claimed the old red Routemaster bus, the famous London symbol also renowned for belching black fumes, was fitted with the recycler in February 1995 and did not have to change its oil until July that year.\n",
            "The London arm of MTL then invited Assali to its headquarters in Liverpool where \"I explained the invention to the top brass.\"\n",
            "Commenting on the financial benefits, he says that MTL as a company uses 40 tonnes of oil a year -- which can easily be cut by a sixth on average by using the recycler.\n",
            "\"We started with three principles in mind -- to save oil, maintain engine quality and to help the environment by cutting polluting emissions.\"\n",
            "The Pinmore filters the oil using a secondary filter controlled by a microprocessor.\n",
            "The filter has a pyramid of discs, down which oil cascades. Discs are heated to 160 degrees, bringing oil to 120 degrees, hotter than the engine temperature. As oil trickles down the discs the contaminants, such as water, diesel fuel and gases evaporate.\n",
            "The resulting vapour is fed into a chamber where it is burned off separately.\n",
            "Very old vehicles like the red Routemaster buses, some of which are 25 years old, can run for 60,000 kilometres (37,280 miles) without changing the oil -- that is six times the normal distance.\n",
            "FIRST BUSES, THEN THE WORLD\n",
            "Pinmore has high hopes for its product and plans to take polluting vehicles by storm. \"We will hit the bus companies first and then the black cab market in London -- 23,000 cabs in total.\n",
            "\"We will then tackle the major UK cities -- Sheffield, Glasgow, Bradford. The market is massive. We could take it to Paris, Frankfurt, Berlin -- every diesel city in Europe.\"\n",
            "MTL now plans to set up a mobile laboratory where anyone can inspect the recycler and the test results.\n",
            "\"We're working towards helping others fight pollution. We're not trying to keep it to ourselves,\" said Locke.\n",
            "\"If we put it into the bus market first, then perhaps someone from the government will say \"If it works for buses then why can't it work for taxis or the private car?'.\" ($1=.5880 Pound)\n",

            "French oil group Elf Aquitaine on Monday signed a landmark oil exploration deal with Azerbaijan, the former Soviet republic which France has described as the next oil Eldorado.\n",
            "The contract is the latest in a string of Western oil deals in the Caspian Sea region, whose waters contain some of the most sought-after oil reserves in the world despite ethnic conflicts and disputes over pipeline rights.\n",
            "Following months of negotiations, Elf signed a production sharing contract for the offshore Lenkoran-Talysh Deniz permit with Azeri national oil firm Socar\n",
            "Symbolising the Baku government's drive to attract Western capital and technology, the contract was signed in the presence of Azeri President Haydar Aliyev, who is on a three-day state visit to France, and French President Jacques Chirac.\n",
            "Aliyev said the pact was worth $1.5 billion and said that it raised total planned investments in Azeri petroleum since a first international contract was signed in 1994 to $15 billion. He added the field should produce 350 million barrels of oil.\n",
            "\"There can be no doubt that Azerbaijan is an open country ready to cooperate with the world,\" he said in a speech to the French Institute of International Affairs (IFRI).\n",
            "Elf, which gave no details of price or production, will take an initial 65 percent stake as operator in the field, while Socar will have 25 percent. Elf's smaller French oil rival Total SA has 10 percent and there are talks for other firms to join.\n",
            "\"The signature of the Lenkoran-Talysh Deniz contract is a major step for the group in its establishment in Azerbaijan,\" Elf chairman and chief executive officer Philippe Jaffre said.\n",
            "The 30-year Lenkoran-Talysh Deniz project allows Elf to seek and produce oil in an area of 420 square kilometres (162.2 sq miles) in waters up to 100 metres (328 ft) deep, located south of Baku in the Caspian Sea.\n",
            "In June 1996, Elf also signed a production sharing contract for a 10 percent interest in a consortium led by British Petroleum Plc on the Shah Deniz permit in the Caspian Sea.\n",
            "French Foreign Minister Herve De Charette said when he visited the area in October that he had obtained \"very precise\" pledges about the role Elf could play on the Azeri oil fields.\n",
            "De Charette called Azerbaijan, which won independence from Moscow in 1991, a new oil Eldorado.\n",
            "But Azerbaijan, which played a dominant role in early oil exploration in the nineteenth century, must deal with a morass of ethnic conflicts and disputes among its neighbours over pipeline routes before it can deliver its latest oil finds to the West.\n",
            "Azerbaijan's largest oil project, a trio of giant Caspian oil fields operated by a consortium led by BP and Norway's Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil), plans to use two pipeline routes for its own output, starting this year.\n",
            "One will send production through strife-torn Chechnya to the Russian Black Sea, the other passing close to Georgia's breakaway region of Abkhazia to the Mediterranean via Turkey.\n",
            "Aliyev gave strong backing for the new pipelines. \"Oil production from this region is going to keep on rising. These oil pipelines must be built. They are necessary,\" he told IFRI.\n",
            "Elf has not said which route any oil to be discovered in the Lenkoran-Talysh Deniz fields might take.\n",

            "Deng, who handpicked Zhao as his successor in 1987 only to sack him two years later for sympathising with student demonstrators gathered in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, died in the capital on Wednesday aged 92. His memorial rites will be held in the Great Hall of the People on Tuesday.\n",
            "Zhao was in the scenic city of Hangzhou in eastern China where he had gone to spend the Chinese lunar New Year earlier this month, said the source who is close to Zhao.\n",
            "Zhao had sent a request to Jiang and other top leaders the day after Deng died, asking for permission to return to the capital after learning of Deng's demise, the source said. Zhao lives under virtual house arrest in Beijing and can move around China only with the approval of the top leadership.\n",
            "Jiang rejected Zhao's request even though Deng's family and some party veterans had agreed to allow him to attend the funeral, the source said. Deng's family could not be reached for comment.\n",
            "\"Not only will the leadership not let him attend the funeral, they also will not let him return to Beijing,\" said the source who asked not to be identified.\n",
            "Zhao renewed his request on February 21, but the leadership had yet to respond, the source said.\n",
            "Surveillance of Zhao was expected to tighten in the run-up to a crucial party congress later this year as Jiang, who has held the post of party chief since Zhao was sacked, tries to consolidate his power, the source said.\n",
            "Zhao has not been seen in public since May 19, 1989 when he visited students occupying Tiananmen Square and, with tears in his eyes, beseeched their leaders to call off their pro-democracy demonstrations. The next day hardliners clamped martial law on the capital.\n",
            "On June 3 and 4, troops firing automatic weapons and backed by tanks stormed the city centre, retaking the square and crushing the demonstrations with heavy loss of life.\n",
            "Zhao was accused by his enemies of backing the \"counter-revolutionary turmoil\" and trying to split the party.\n",
            "Diplomats say China's current leadership remains nervous of the influence of Zhao, whose relatively liberal political and economic policies made him popular while in office.\n",
            "Party mandarins fear Zhao could be a wild card if he were to re-emerge from his virtual house arrest in a post-Deng power struggle, diplomats said.\n",
            "Zhao has refused to acknowledge making mistakes, giving him some clout among Chinese who disagree with the verdict of hardliners that the 1989 protests were seditious, diplomats said.\n",

            "The agreement binding 3Com and Robotics to the $7.3-billion merger, announced last Wednesday, requires either party to pay up to $160 million if the deal falls through, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission 8-K filing over the weekend.\n",
            "3Com closed on Monday at 32-13/16, down 19/64 on the day. U.S. Robotics shares, which have traded in tandem with the ups and downs of 3Com stock, closed at 55-3/8, down 7/16.\n",
            "Terms of the merger call for 3Com to exchange 1.75 shares of its stock for each Robotics share. The exchange ratio is fixed with no collar, according to officials of the two companies.\n",
            "The value of the 3Com offer to Robotics shareholders -- which stood at $68 when the deal was announced -- has fallen in line with the six-point decline in 3Com shares. At Monday's close, the offer was worth $57-27/64 in Robotics shares.\n",
            "Analysts said shareholder disatisfaction with the proposal extends into mid-level management at Robotics. Options given employees in recent years are worthless at current price levels.  \n",
            "One investment banker not involved in the deal said he made inquiries after the announcement seeking alternative bidders. \"What we found is that there was not a high level of interest among competitors to enter a rival bid to 3Com,\" he said.\n",
            "In the near-term, 3Com's rivals appear content to let the deal stand, seeing the distraction of managing the integration of 3Com, a leading corporate network supplier, with Robotics, the top consumer modem maker, as a competitive advantage.\n",
            "Competitors \"preferred to see 3Com and Robotics go through this period of pain instead of doing anything to break the deal up,\" the banker said. \"They feel this deal is going to slow 3Com in the near-term.\"\n",
            "But analysts said the deal was vulnerable because it involved a stock swap only, leaving it open to someone willing to pay cash or a stronger stock price. A shareholder vote is not expected for several months, giving rivals time to mull options.\n",
            "\"It's very possible that if the 3Com price continues to fall, USRX continues to fall too,\" Senan said. \"If I were a USRX shareholder, I would be willing to consider other bids.\"\n",

            "A battle is shaping up for control of Russia's Fuel and Energy Ministry after the minister resigned, and the losers are likely to be Western firms eyeing deals in the lucrative Russian oil sector, industry sources said on Monday.\n",
            "The Kremlin has not yet named a replacement for Pyotr Rodionov, who tendered his surprise resignation on Friday, leaving almost no record of substantial achievements after eight months in the job.\n",
            "But the sources said Moscow, abuzz with talk of possible replacements, was likely to install a person whose priority was domestic oil producers, not Western joint ventures or output-sharing deals dominated by energy multinationals.\n",
            "\"Rodionov didn't have any real feel for the oil sector,\" said one Western source. \"He wasn't a plus or a negative -- he was a nonentity.\"\n",
            "Russian news agencies tipped Alexander Samusev, vice-president of Rosprom-YUKOS, Russia's second largest oil producer, and a former deputy minister in the Fuel and Energy and Finance Ministries, as the likely replacement.\n",
            "YUKOS and its shareholder, Bank Menatep, declined to comment. Rosprom is an industrial holding firm attached to Menatep.\n",
            "Sources said First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, a new cabinet reformist in charge of natural monopolies and energy issues, wanted his own unnamed choice in the post.\n",
            "Either option would install a candidate with market economy sensibilities but also a keen desire to make Russian oil firms the dominant players in the world's third biggest crude producer.\n",
            "\"Having somebody from Menatep run the energy ministry wouldn't be particularly good news for Western companies,\" said a European industry executive.\n",
            "\"I would expect him, if he gets the job, to take a tough line in terms of favouring Russian commercial banks.\"\n",
            "Samusev, seen as a reformer and experienced in the state and private sectors, played a key role in winning oil export tax exemptions for joint ventures in the early years of reform.\n",
            "But that was years ago when domestic oil firms were just beginning to privatise and integrate with refining and marketing units and were in no shape to finance anything on their own.\n",
            "Russian companies now want controlling stakes in production sharing deals and are upset that they must pay taxes on some oil produced by ventures for which their partners are exempt.\n",
            "\"There is a concern that the Russian producers want to go it alone,\" said the Western source, adding that whoever headed the ministry could make terms tougher for Western oil companies.\n",
            "Samusev is a key link between YUKOS and Menatep in their stalled production-sharing talks with U.S.-based Amoco Corp on the $52 billion Priobsk field. The talks have faltered because the Russian side wants greater leverage and ownership in the deal.\n",
            "Rodionov, appointed in August 1996, was previously director of Lentransgaz, the St Petersburg-based transport unit of Russian natural gas monopoly Gazprom  GAZP.RTS.\n",
            "He left the oil sector entirely to his deputies, leaving Western oil firms -- which are ready to invest tens of billions of dollars if Moscow passes the necessary laws -- wondering whether Moscow had fundamentally changed its once more welcoming attitude towards outside participation in the energy sector.\n",
            "Western firms have long said they can secure the financing to reverse lower output, which has almost halved in the last 10 years and was 6.03 million barrels per day in 1996. But that may change now that Russia has a sovereign debt rating.\n",
            "\"It looks like Russian oil companies and banks are beginning to land financing that they couldn't have a year-ago,\" said the European source, adding that domestic commercial banks could be seeking to exert more leverage over the sector.\n",

            "Boeing Co. stock surged Tuesday after the company decided to scrap plans to build a costly stretch version of its 747 jumbo jet.\n",
            "Boeing shares jumped $5.625 to a record $112.125 on the New York Stock Exchange, accounting for much of the rise in the Dow Jones industrial average. Boeing is one of 30 stocks in the index of blue-chip companies.\n",
            "Industry analysts estimated the move by the world's largest aircraft manufacturer, announced late on Monday, could reduce Boeing's research and development costs by more than $2 billion over the next five years and boost annual earnings by as much as $1 a share.\n",
            "NatWest Securities analyst Nick Heymann said the decision not to proceed with the risky project removed a cloud of uncertainty over Boeing as it ramps up production to meet rising demand and prepares to complete its planned $14 billion purchase of McDonnell Douglas Corp.\n",
            "\"It's fantastic news,\" he said.\n",
            "While officials at Boeing rival Airbus Industrie said the European consortium would go ahead with plans for an all-new superjumbo jetliner called the A-3XX, Heymann said he thought that project was dead.\n",
            "\"Airbus never really had the resources to go ahead with their aircraft,\" Heymann said.\n",
            "He said it was even less likely the European consortium could raise the funds now that Boeing has talked with the same customers and determined market conditions did not justify the investment needed for a new big jet.\n",
            "Boeing said it would cost more than $7 billion just to develop a new wing and make other changes needed to produce two new versions of the 747 that would add range and capacity.\n",
            "Airbus has said it can develop and all-new jet for $8 billion, but analysts peg the total costs at closer to a whopping $15 billion.\n",
            "Citing increasing \"route fragmentation,\" especially across the Pacific Ocean, Boeing said it plans to focus its development efforts on new versions of the medium-sized 767 and 777 twin-engine models.\n",
            "Boeing already has begun offering an increased-capacity version of the 767 that could be launched with an initial order in the next few months.\n",
            "Boeing also is considering new versions of the 777 that would add both capacity and range.\n",
            "Heymann said Boeing also plans minor changes in the 747 including new digital cockpit electronics and computer software. The revamped plane would be the same size with the same range as the current 747-400, Boeing's latest version of the four-engine plane.\n",
            "Alfred Goldman, a stock market analyst at brokers A.G. Edwards and Sons, said the rise in Boeing stock accounted for nearly half of the Dow's rise of about 34 points, to 6,878, at midday.\n",

            "As a result of initial findings of a wide-ranging internal probe into the loss, the bank also took drastic action to restore confidence by suspending four senior members of staff and cutting millions of pounds from bonuses.\n",
            "NatWest said the total loss was 90 million pounds ($144 million) but that five million had already been provisioned and eight million had been clawed back by not paying the bonuses, making a loss of 77 million pounds in the accounts.\n",
            "It also said Martin Owen, chief executive of the NatWest Markets investment banking division, would forego 200,000 pounds of his 500,000 pounds 1996 bonus.\n",
            "\"It is extremely regrettable that the losses and the mis-pricing have gone undetected for so long. Although confined to one area this is a significant setback for NatWest Markets,\" Derek Wanless, NatWest's chief executive, said.\n",
            "The bank said the losses had started in late 1994 and were confined to its interest rate options area. It said it had suspended four more members of staff, appointed an acting head of global debt derivatives and would not pay bonuses totalling 8.0 million pounds to certain members of staff.\n",
            "The bank said the initial findings of an inquiry into the losses, which were first revealed nearly two weeks ago, had found no flaws in the models used to calculate valuations of the derivatives in question.\n",
            "Neil Dodgson, global head of options, has already been suspended and options trader Kyriacos Papouis left the firm in December.\n",
            "It said the further suspensions were Ian Gaskell, head of swaps options trading for Britain and Europe, Christophe Lanson, global head of rate risk management, Jean-Francois Nguyen, managing director of debt derivatives and Phil Wise, chief administrative officer and formerly senior managing director of capital markets.\n",

            "Critics say the politically-charged comedy/drama, which draws heavily on the decades of animosity -- and jokes -- Czechs had for occupying Russian forces, may be one of the region's best offerings since the Czech new wave of the 1960s.\n",

            "After landing a deal with Miramax to distribute \"Kolya\" the Sveraks are working on an original English-language feature. The project is still a secret, while Zdenek finishes the script.\n",
            "After a film, television, and stage career which has made him one of the most popular personalities in the country since the early 1970s, Zdenek says he has no regrets that he did not defect to pursue his career like so many Czechs including Oscar-winning director Milos Forman.\n",
            "Jan, who came of age as a director after the revolution, says he will stay in Prague, despite offers to go abroad.\n",

            "\"Past efforts to broach the subject publicly have been greeted not only with stony official silence from the Hong Kong government, but with dismay and anger in other quarters that sometimes verged on the hysterical,\" she said.\n",

            "\"Something like two thirds of the world's population live more than a day's walk away from the nearest telephone,\" says John Tysoe, telecoms analyst at brokers SocGen. \"There's a whole world out there waiting to get in touch.\"\n",
            "In the last 12 months, potential mergers have run to tens of billions of dollars as carriers such as MFS WorldCom British Telecommunications Plc and MCI Communications Corp, Bell Atlantic /NYNEX and SBC/Pacific Telesis announced plans to join forces.\n",
            "MARKET FORCES BATTER TELECOM MONOPOLIES\n",
            "Because the cost of making calls is expected to reflect more closely the cost of delivering them, consumers will soon no longer pay the vastly inflated prices that have helped line the pockets of bloated national carriers.\n",
            "The advent of high bandwidth cable and modern switching systems also means that, according to some broker estimates, the cost of delivering a telephone call is about a thousand times cheaper than 40 years ago.\n",
            "A number of firms, facing margin-shrinking competition at home and aiming to service corporations, have formed three main global partnerships.\n",
            "BT and its American partner MCI have formed an alliance called Concert; Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and America's Sprint have linked up to form Global One.\n",
            "AT&amp;T, the world's second largest telecoms company, has also set up loosely-knit partnerships called Unisource and World Partners.\n",
            "Telecommuncations used to be rather simple: Spend money to fix your network, cut capital expenditure and staffing levels and wait for the cash to start piling up.\n",
            "The more money is spent on a network, the greater the cash flows allowed by regulators to support its renewal, and the greater the potential free cash-flow improvement, when savings are eventually enjoyed.\n",
            "But a brave, new world is on the horizon, and the only telecoms stocks Harrington tips for investors are those which enjoy double-digit growth, are gaining share in their existing markets, and have assets in place to execute strategic plans -- or have a unique niche.\n",
            "CABLE &amp; WIRELESS PROVIDES A RARE ASSET BASE\n",
            "Such firms could include Cable and Wireless, Britain's second biggest telecoms company, which analysts say combines an attractive home asset base with rare access to booming Asian markets.\n",
            "C&amp;W has a majority stake in Hong Kong Telecommunications, described as one of the best assets in Asia because it is not only majority held by non-government investors, but has potentially unique access to China and already faces competition at home.\n",
            "'CONCERT' IS BANKING ON JAPAN\n",
            "BT is also hoping that its planned takeover of MCI will make it more attractive as a potential partner to Asian companies such as Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp, the world's largest telecoms titan.\n",
            "But the MCI deal has led rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's to put BT on \"CreditWatch with negative implications.\"\n",
            "\"The expected downgrade of BT's (AAA) ratings reflect the company's increased business risk and weakened business profile resulting from its ($22 billion) acquisition of MCI,\" S&amp;P said last month.\n",
            "Nevertheless, most analysts welcomed the proposed merger as a strategic necessity to create a viable, competitive group with a broad geographical reach.\n",
            "As the U.S. market opens further, and since Europe created its single market in 1988, around 80 percent of the global telecoms market, by revenue, will be either completely or substantially deregulated by 1998 compared with about 20 percent today.\n",

            "Aberfoyle said both companies would make a final decision by the end of the September quarter.\n",
            "Ashton owns 77.5 percent of Merlin. Aberfoyle has the rest.\n",
            "The feasibility study assumes a modest start to mining, with stage one annual capacity of 500,000 tonnes of ore. Ashton has already said the first stage would cost about A$20 million (US$15.2 million).\n",
            "The joint venture partners plan to develop some open pits before evaluating Merlin's underground mining resource and proceeding to a stage two expansion.\n",
            "\"We are still encouraged by what we have seen by the further work on site and the further (work on the) feasibility study and certainly there is no reason for discouragement,\" Eager said.\n",
            "The Merlin prospect contains about 12 kimberlite pipes -- rock formations associated with diamonds -- and only three of them have been bulk sampled for diamonds so far, he said.\n",
            "The sampling results suggest further upside to the project, Eager added.\n",

            "Even before Cie de Suez  head Gerard Mestrallet has confirmed he is considering a merger with utilities group Lyonnaise des Eaux, the market is already betting that he will run the new group.\n",
            "Brokers, fed by newspaper reports and market rumours, are convinced financial conglomerate Suez and Lyonnaise will merge to create a utilities group with an estimated market capitalisation of 79 billion francs ($13.9 billion) that will give new life to both companies.\n",
            "A decision on who would head a merged group could play a key role in determining which company gains the upper hand in running the combined entity.\n",
            "Two elements argue for the merger. Suez, after selling key assets to make good property losses, has a big cash hoard and 50 billion francs in capital -- but little industrial identity.\n",
            "And at Lyonnaise, chairman Jerome Monod, 66, is preparing his retirement. A merger would not only financially strengthen the company but give fresh leadership.\n",
            "Odds are heavily in favour of Mestrallet who took over Suez two years ago after a boardroom battle ousted then chairman Gerard Worms. Mestrallet was brought in from Suez's Belgian unit Societe Generale de Belgique (SGB).\n",
            "\"He's the favourite,\" said an analyst, who declined to be named. \"He has done an impressive job.\"\n",
            "\"Mestrallet has shown his worth,\" an investment banker said.\n",
            "He sold key assets including investment bank Banque Indosuez and is credited for bringing Suez back to profit.\n",
            "The company made a 1995 net attributable loss of 3.96 billion francs, due to provisions for property losses, but analysts expect it to report a 1996 net profit of about 1.15 billion francs.\n",
            "Mestrallet has narrowed Suez's focus to utilities, held through its Tractebel subsidiary owned by SGB. But the company has been left with an \"identity problem\".\n",
            "Suez had become a \"piggy bank,\" stuffed with cash and equity capital, while Lyonnaise needs funds to finance its expansion.\n",
            "Mestrallet, 47, son of a shopkeeper, graduated from the elite Ecole Polytechnique and the Ecole Nationale d'Administration (ENA) and worked as chief of staff to Jacques Delors at the French Finance Ministry before his boss became president of the European Commission.\n",
            "His rival for power is Guy de Panafieu, the number two to Monod at Lyonnaise.\n",
            "De Panafieu, 53, is also a graduate of ENA, the fast-track school for senior posts in government and industry. He managed the integration of the troubled Dumez construction firm since its 1990 acquisition by Lyonnaise.\n",
            "But de Panafieu, although seen as having handled Dumez well, is too closely identified with Monod, the analyst said.\n",

            "In buying Dumez, Lyonnaise inherited foreign contracts which cost hundreds of millions in provisions as disputes grew. Lyonnaise, already struggling with property losses, had to sell assets to fund provisions for those contract disputes.\n",
            "\"The company has lost time and has sold everything. It does not have a lot of asset support\", said the analyst.\n",

            "Unilever's stock surged on the results, which were better than the 53 billion pounds ($4.13 billion) analysts had forecast, and the planned sale of the speciality chemicals businesses.\n",
            "Chairman Niall FitzGerald said the overall economic situation in 1997 was likely to be generally favourable, as in 1996, but he warned about market conditions in Europe, particularly France and Germany.\n",
            "He said the planned sale of Unilever's speciality chemicals businesses would enable the company to concentrate on achieving growth in its consumer goods operations, particularly in developing and emerging markets.\n",
            "\"We will now seek actively buyers for the totality or the individual businesses and we will then assess those over the next month or two,\" he told Reuters in an interview. \"We would hope to conclude a sale in the course of the next three to six months.\"\n",
            "FitzGerald declined to say how much the businesses might be worth. The four units -- National Starch and Chemical Company, Quest International, Unichema International and Crosfield -- have combined revenue of 3.0 billion pounds ($4.9 billion), 9 percent of Unilever's total sales, and showed operating profit of 415 million pounds ($678 million) in 1996, with profit margins of 14.1 percent.\n",
            "\"These are extremely large and important parts of our businesses, but for some time we have been reviewing whether they should be a continuing part of the portfolio -- not because they are poorly performing themselves, they are excellent performers -- but whether we can give them the concentration and the focus that they require,\" FitzGerald said.\n",
            "\"They are essentially industrial businesses selling not to consumers but to intermediate customers. They are very fine businesses,\" he said. \"But if you look at the way this industry is developing, we have to take a decision either to significantly improve our presence in these markets, perhaps double it, or to exit and in exiting to concentrate on the other 90 percent of our business, which is our mainstream consumer goods business.\"\n",
            "The four companies together make up one of the world's largest speciality chemicals groups, employing 15,800 people in more than 35 countries.\n",
            "Unilever is the world's largest producer of both margarine and ice cream, and its activities span food, personal products, such as Pond's cold cream, and household goods brands, including laundry detergents and Lux soap.\n",

            "SBC Communications Inc said on Tuesday that soaring demand for wireless services is beating its expectations and shows no signs of slowing down in 1997.\n",
            "\"I'm amazed by how much momentum we have. Frankly its in advance of our business plans, and its due to both the healthy economy and an overall exploding telecom marketplace,\" SBC Chief Financial Officer Don Kiernan told Reuters.\n",
            "SBC's U.S. wireless user base jumped by 20.2 percent to 4.4 million during 1996, with 739,000 customers added compared with an internal forecast of 600,000-650,000.\n",
            "The company was a cent below First Call's analyst consensus with earnings per share of $0.90 for the fourth quarter compared with $0.83 a year earlier, though Kiernan said the miss was less once rounding errors were discounted.\n",
            "SBC shares, which lost as much as 1/2 immediately after the results, were unchanged at $52-3/4 at 1500 EST/2000 GMT.\n",
            "Wireless is providing SBC with new outlets for services like caller ID and voice dialling, which gives and extra kick to revenues in a fast growing marketplace, Kiernan said.\n",
            "During 1996 1.9 million SBC wireless customers took cellular long distance, 42.5 percent of the total, which generated $60 million extra in revenues.\n",
            "\"As wireless customers realise its not that much more expensive to use a cellular phone to make a long distance call we could get a real windfall...,\" Kiernan said.\n",
            "On top of this services such as Caller ID are a big boost to revenues and profits, first because they cost almost nothing to provide to each marginal user and because they help retain customers who might switch between providers.\n",
            "\"Revenue per customer in wireless is down only 1.5 percent from the prior year,\" Kiernan said. Wireless companies have come to expect bigger falls in average revenue per user as falling prices enable casual users to take a mobile phone.\n",
            "Traditionally, wireless providers cope by switching to cheaper methods of acquiring new customers through retailers or resellers to offset marginal revenue declines.\n",
            "But Kiernan said value-added services help support the wireless revenue curve, even as costs decline.\n",
            "Already SBC reaped over $1 billion in revenues in 1996 from value-added services, mostly on the wired network.\n",
            "In wired networks a new generation of software-based features would be available in mid-1997 using advanced intelligent networks (AIN), Kiernan said.\n",
            "AIN means a phone or data network carries plenty of its own computing power and more information about a call than existing networks.\n",
            "Desktop video conferencing is available already, but others will include call management based on information extracted from caller-ID records. Eventually many of the new features will migrate to the wireless network too.\n",
            "Kiernan said that SBC had just last week started selling a package of local and long distance calling, plus local and long distance wireless under the Cellular One brand in New York state.\n",
            "\"We will be rolling that out in our other out-of-region markets in Chicago, Washington/Baltimore, Boston during 1997, so that will further buoy up average revenue per customer,\" he said. ((-- New York Newsrom 212 859 1610))\n",

            "EYES ON ASIA AND CHINA MARKETS\n",
            "Ruby's group recently launched a joint venture with a subsidiary of Australia-listed Lend Lease in Singapore with plans to provide 10,000 serviced apartments in Asia, and intends to take aim at London during the next year.\n",
            "Ruby foresees large-scale expansion in the sector in the Far East, especially in China, with much of American industry abuzz with plans to move people into the region.\n",
            "Chinese cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou have large expatriate populations as well as large numbers of home-grown professionals moving around the country on assignment who need temporary serviced housing.\n",
            "\"I just finished a tour of major client companies in the United States. Every single one is planning an expansion into the Far East, with most of them talking about China.\n",
            "\"Telecommunications, software companies, all the way through to clothing and furniture manufacturers. They're all talking China right now. Whereas a company might have sent 10 people last year, they're expecting to send over 20 people this coming year,\" he said.\n",
            "The serviced apartment industry is starting to break away from the niche market identity and family-style business of old into a multifaceted service industry, Ruby believes.\n",
            "CORPORATE RELOCATIONS PROVIDE HUGE MARKET POTENTIAL\n",
            "Oakwood is the largest national provider of serviced apartments in the United States, with offices in 60 cities, more than 17,000 apartments and 25,000 clients including 400 of the Fortune 500 companies and 75 of the world's top multinationals.\n",
            "The potential of the business is highlighted by one client that carries out 50,000 relocations of staff a year, with an average three months stay in temporary housing, Ruby said.\n",
            "A company like General Motors, for example, might need help with relocation or temporary housing for staff moved around on training, special projects like setting up new production lines and might put out 25,000 apartment requirements a year.\n",
            "Ruby started out catering to the niche market of new college graduates three decades ago -- apartments for baby boomers.\n",
            "He moved on to corporate housing when companies asked for more services, such as maid service and taking care of bills.\n",
            "SERVICED APARTMENTS TO BECOME MULTIFACETED SERVICE\n",
            "He sees the business progressing to include video conferencing, Internet hookups, sports and recreation facilities, orientation tours, child care and job search agencies for spouses.\n",
            "\"This way a serviced apartment offers a branded service dedicated to the needs of the corporate customer. They are not just a physical facility, but a service provider,\" he said.\n",
            "\"Companies do not want staff transfers to end in failure because of a dissatisfied spouse. So we want to provide a service that makes a transfer a success.\"\n",
            "With an increasingly cluttered market, customers looked now to a reputable brand as their one point of contact, Ruby said.\n",
            "DEALS IN THE PIPELINE IN ASIA\n",
            "In the Far East, Oakwood and partners are working on deals in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Manila and Bangkok.\n",
            "The first Asian project to go onstream will be Oakwood Premier, a serviced apartment scheme in Shanghai's historic Xuhui district, where the French concession was located in pre-revolutionary times. The property, owned by a Hong Kong family, will open later this year.\n",
            "\"As the industry matures in Asia, dedicated service companies will be the providers of choice for the corporations leasing the majority of serviced apartments,\" Ruby said.\n",

            "As a first step, the company will unveil on Monday a music network on the Internet using multimedia technology from Intel Corp.\n",
            "JAMtv plans to broadcast live concerts, link with radio stations for other programming, sell CDs and other merchandise and provide daily news and reviews.\n",
            "The company is also working with privately held BackWeb, one of the leading \"push\" technology companies, which broadcasts personalized news and information directly to a person's PC.\n",
            "\"The goal is that you will have your own personal jukebox on your computer,\" Howard Tullman, chief executive of JAMtv, said.\n",
            "JAMtv spun out from Jam Productions Ltd, a well-known concert producer and promoter in Chicago whose co-founder, Jerry Mickelsen, is chairman.\n",
            "The company hopes its network will become the main source of music on the Internet, featuring contemporary and alternative rock arists and eventually country and jazz.\n",
            "But JAMtv is not trying to be the MTV of the Internet, Tullman stressed.\n",
            "He noted that in recent years MTV has had to change its programming to offer more shows and features, like the \"Real World\" soap opera, because MTV viewers tired of someone else making their programming decisions for them.\n",
            "\"It's a network of one,\" Tullman said of the planned JAMtv service.\n",
            "\"Anytime you go there, you can listen to what you want. You don't have to wait for someone to make these programming decisions for you,\" he said. \"We will let you design your profile and what you want.\"\n",
            "He said the JAMtv site on the World Wide Web will have daily events, with a calender of more than 1,500 events already planned for this year based on upcoming Jam Productions events, such as a U2 concert in Soldier Field in Chicago as part of the group's tour.\n",
            "Users of the JAMtv site can also buy from a catalog of more than 140,000 music CDs, 70,000 music and entertainment videos and access an archive of images, audio, video and other data on hundreds of artists.\n",
            "Tullman also said JAMtv was talking to computer makers and to Microsoft Corp. and Netscape Commuications Corp. in an effort in get a spot on the Windows desktop and a part of the Netscape browser, so that users will be able to simply click on an icon and have their JAMtv.\n",
            "JAMtv is also embracing Intel's \"hybrid\" method of sending fat audio and video files over the Internet, by providing users with compact disks of some audio and video, which is then supplemented by updated audio and video streams sent over the Internet.\n",
            "The company hopes to make money is several ways, by selling merchandise over the Internet, by selling advertising and licensing fees to radio affiliates for programming and through compiling databases on subscribers which it could sell to record companies.\n",
            "Ultimately, Tullman said, a big JAMtv revenue stream will come from a \"pay-per-view\" distribution of live concerts on the Internet.\n",
            "\"At the end of the day, when you can truly go home at night and click on your PC and watch any concert you want, there will be pay per view revenues in this business,\" Tullman said.\n",

            "Banned as bourgeois decadence in China's ultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, Valentine's Day has since emerged as an opportunity for shy lovers to make public expressions of affection -- and as a red-letter day for flower sellers.\n",
            "The Beijing Flower Supermarket, which supplies the capital with 80 percent of its fresh flowers, expects to see sales jump 400 percent on Valentine's Day this year, said one salesman with a company affiliated with the market.\n",
            "\"I estimate the market will sell about one million flowers,\" Kong Li of the Beijing Huaxianzi Flower Delivery Co said in an interview. \"Valentine's Day is our most lively day.\"\n",
            "FROM RED BOOKS TO RED ROSES\n",
            "Scenes of fanatical Red Guards waving little red books of Chairman Mao Zedong's quotations have given way to a growing army of amorous youth bearing red roses, who are more passionate about the opposite sex than about the latest political pronouncements from Beijing.\n",
            "\"The Chinese love excitement and a reason to get worked up. Valentine's Day is an excuse to do that,\" Kong said.\n",
            "\"When there were no flowers, Chinese used other ways to express their feelings. Now that we have fresh flowers more people like to give them as gifts,\" Kong said.\n",
            "Nearly two decades of market-oriented reforms launched by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping have mixed the forces of the market with those of the heart, with lucrative results for pedlars of petals.\n",
            "A budding flower industry emerged in China in the mid-1980s but it wasn't until Deng put his seal of approval on the country's capitalist-style reforms in 1992 that the sector really started to bloom, Kong said.\n",
            "\"Flowers have become more popular mainly because of the reforms and opening up,\" he said.\n",
            "A ROSE FOR HALF A WEEK'S INCOME\n",
            "Fresh roses for Valentine's Day are flown to wintry Beijing mainly from major growing areas around the southern boomtown of Guangzhou in Guangdong province and Kunming in the temperate southwestern province of Yunnan, Kong said.\n",
            "Many roses are also imported from the Netherlands, he said.\n",
            "Demand for roses on Valentine's Day can send the price of a single flower soaring to 50 yuan ($6.00), or half a week's income for an average urban resident.\n",
            "Beijing's flower dealers normally purchase domestic roses for around five yuan each from southern growers but the price can jump as high as 15 yuan in the run-up to Valentine's Day, Kong said.\n",
            "Retail prices can be more than double that by the time the flowers hit the stalls in Beijing.\n",
            "\"We can sell a Chinese rose for 25 yuan on Valentine's Day. Imported ones can sell for 50 yuan,\" he said. An average city dweller made about 420 yuan a month in 1995.\n",
            "Flower sellers who rent stall space at the state-run flower market reap huge profits from the mark-ups.\n",
            "\"I can make 10,000 yuan in profit on a good day like Valentine's Day,\" said Liu Cheng, manager of one stall.\n",
            "FASHIONABLY HIP YOUTH ARE GENEROUS LOVERS\n",
            "Whereas institutional buyers such as hotels and corporations made up the bulk of business in the past, ordinary residents with more money in their pockets are increasingly becoming the mainstay of the industry, Kong said.\n",
            "\"One guy last year bought 900 roses for Valentine's Day,\" stall manager Liu said.\n",
            "Trend-conscious young people were sending more flowers to friends and relatives for birthdays and at the new year as well as on Valentine's Day, Kong said.\n",
            "\"It's mostly young people in their 20s,\" Kong said. \"Most of those who buy flowers are well-educated and cultured.\"\n",
            "Kong predicted the Beijing flower market would double within three years, but hefty prices could be a thorn in the side for less well-off Chinese hoping to send their sweethearts a token of their affection.\n",

            "Holding company Cie de Suez  and utility Lyonnaise des Eaux must tell shareholders how they will benefit from the groups' planned merger, otherwise the deal will look like a defensive move, analysts said on Friday.\n",
            "The boards of Suez and Lyonnaise are expected to approve later on Friday terms of the merger which will create a group with annual sales of about 200 billion francs ($35 billion) and a market capitalisation of 75 billion.\n",
            "But size is not necessarily a bonus if the new group cannot bring operating companies together and if Suez is not allowed to sell Belgian financial assets to shed its conglomerate status and focus on utilities.\n",
            "\"If there is no link-up between Lyonnaise and Suez, the merger makes little sense. It looks like a defensive move,\" a share analyst said.\n",
            "Lyonnaise chairman Jerome Monod told Europe 1 radio on Friday that the new group would have four core businesses -- energy, water distribution, waste management and communications.\n",
            "\"What do shareholders stand to gain?\" a second analyst asked. \"There is still uncertainty,\" he added.\n",
            "In the short term, Suez shareholders can look forward to  a big cash payout as part of the merger terms, with a dividend estimated at around 24 francs per share, or a total of some 3.8 billion francs.\n",
            "They are also getting a chance to cut the discount on Suez shares compared with underlying assets -- if the new group buries Suez's holding company image by selling financial assets to concentrate on utilities, as promised.\n",
            "Suez investors will also gain by getting shares in Lyonnaise, which for all its past weakness, is one of France's biggest companies and harbours big expansion ambitions.\n",
            "But Suez holders still need to be convinced on big issues related to the merger.\n",
            "The merger is being structured as a Lyonnaise takeover of Suez, apparently to take advantage of Suez's tax loss carry-forward, which would shelter future profits of the new group. \"This needs to be clarified,\" said an analyst.\n",
            "For Lyonnaise shareholders, the deal looks more risky.\n",
            "They do not know if Suez chairman Gerard Mestrallet has made guarantees of management freedom to the Belgian government for the Societe Generale de Belgique holding company, which groups choice industrial and financial assets.\n",
            "Any commitments may inhibit SGB's disposal of Belgian financial assets, which include stakes in banking giant Generale de Banque and insurer Fortis.\n",
            "French investment in Belgium has become a sensitive issue since Renault SA's decision to close its Vilvoorde plant near Brussels at heavy cost to jobs.\n",
            "The Belgian authorities insist on keeping the Tractebel utilities company, 50.3 percent owned by SGB, independent and headquartered in Belgium. This may limit the scope for integrating Tractebel into Lyonnaise's global ambitions.\n",
            "Howver, Tractebel could benefit from asset transfers from Lyonnaise, such as the Elyo energy subsidiary.\n",
            "The disposal of Suez's French financial units such as consumer credit house Sofinco, property broker Banque Monod and insurer Henin Vie, pose less of a problem.\n",
            "Credit Agricole, which last year bought Banque Indosuez, has an option to buy 20 percent of Sofinco next year.\n",
            "Lyonnaise shareholders stand to gain an injection of fresh capital which the company needs to finance its global aspirations. But if the Suez disposals do not go according to plan, they will be left with a conglomerate on their hands, with the accompanying discount on the shares. ($ = 5.789 French Francs)\n",

            "Norilsk pulses with the ghosts of at least 100,000 political prisoners whom Soviet dictator Josef Stalin exiled to this forsaken spot in the 1930s and 40s to work one of the planet's richest, but most desolate, sites for turning mineral deposits of nickel, platinum, gold and other ores into pure metals.\n",
            "For Mitrofan Rubeko, a rare 85-year-old survivor of Stalin's purges, Norilsk, 200 miles (320 km) north of the Arctic Circle, is an outpost of outrage. \"None of the young want to remember the history of Norilsk,\" he said in his spartan apartment.\n",
            "Norilsk has no monument to the innocent victims of forced labour, no mention of them in the town museum and no talk of one of the most prominent episodes in the Soviet Union's climb to a communist industrial heaven. Not one book has been published in Russia on the town's real history. Company officials have ignored Rubeko's request to erect a monument.\n",
            "Norilsk does have a monument to the town's first \"engineers\". Most were officers in the secret police that later became the KGB. They supervised thinly clad prisoners labouring in the open air and sleeping in wooden barracks with ice floors.\n",
            "Norilsk now has three nickel and copper smelters, two of them skeletal dinosaurs belching poisonous gases. It has metals processing and enriching plants and some of the world's richest mines of nickel, platinum, palladium, cobalt, copper and gold.\n",
            "The new generations of Norilsk's 300,000 residents -- some descendents of Stalin's victims, others children of later, hardy souls who headed north decades ago for higher wages -- are miners and metalworkers who look a decade older than they are.\n",
            "\"It's so ecologically dangerous in Norilsk, you aren't even supposed to give birth here,\" said Sergei Yurshov, director of the main nickel plant's electrolysing unit.\n",

            "\"The state sees the bullion, but this is all we see,\" said Boris Degtyarov, an official at the main trade union.\n",
            "There is more beautiful poison at the electrolysing plant, where luminous, lime-green liquid nickel, laced with electricity, is processed from matt black slabs glinting with the earth's most prized metals.\n",
            "The dark cobbled floors and 1940s technology, exposing steel entrails and frames of processing lines, have a mediaeval air.\n",
            "Concentrations of carcinogenic nickel in the air are 200 times Western norms and 20,000 times the worthy but never attained Soviet standard.\n",
            "In Norilsk, women retire at 40, men at 45. Degtyarov says 90 percent of newborn babies have serious illnesses or handicaps. An aura of illness pervades everything here. One mine, Keyerkan, means Valley of Death in the language of the local Dolgan people.\n",
            "Despite the richness of its ore mines, Norilsk has not created wealth for its workers.\n",
            "Difficulties in keeping tabs on just who exports its multi-billion dollar output, and vast tax arrears have not helped the labour force, whose wages are two months behind.\n",
            "\"Where's the money for the metals going?\" asked Rubeko, shaking his silver-haired head. \"That I cannot understand.\"\n",
            "A FROZEN, UNDERGROUND HELL\n",
            "Deep in the Taimyr mine, 1.5 km (one mile) below the permafrost, is a darker world, where miners labour round the clock in shifts and cavernous tunnels worm through the earth.\n",

            "\"The lift cables are rusted,\" said duty operator, Sergei. \"But we love our jobs,\" he added, inciting laughter from miners waiting to be ferried down into the bowels of the Arctic.\n",
            "The Soviet authorities saw Norilsk as the embodiment of the socialist city-factory and as an organising principle for society. Now the remains of that vision are being tested by new market forces. Already hundreds of homeless live in the town's boiler plants.\n",
            "Company officials speak of uprooting pensioners to warmer climes, where they would cost less to support, and of the need to trim a bloated workforce.\n",
            "The plans have made Norilsk a barometer of the troubles faced by Russian industries in casting off their Soviet legacy. But they are hotly contested.\n",
            "\"You'd need two Kalashnikovs for every policeman if you had a load of unemployed wandering these streets,\" Degtyarov said.\n",
            "Rubeko, dragged to Norilsk in 1938 after a midnight knock at his door in southern Russia, despairs at the thought of a second exile. \"You can't resettle an 85-year-old man,\" he said.\n",

            "Regulators Wednesday approved a landmark overhaul of domestic telephone charges that they said will lower costs for residential and business customers who make plenty of long-distance calls.\n",
            "Federal Communications Commimssion officials said basic local phone rates will stay the same. But consumers and businesses will pay more for extra phone lines and would see see their bills rise if they seldom dial long distance.\n",
            "The FCC also voted to set aside about $2.3 billion a year to wire the nation's schools and libraries to the Internet at discounted rates. Another $400 million a year will be used to connect rural hospitals to the global computer network.\n",
            "The new rates stem from last year's communications law and generally were praised by consumer advocates. Regional Baby Bell phone companies criticised the rules. And small-business advocates complained they will receive higher phone bills.\n",
            "The matter ultimately is expected to land in court.\n",
            "According to the FCC, the overhaul will mean that:\n",
            "-- Residential customers with one phone line will see their long-distance bill drop to $20.65 a month from $22.50 by 1998, on average.\n",
            "-- A couple with two phone lines in Charleston, S.C., and a long-distance bill of $60 a month, under a special calling plan, would save a total of about $2.50 a month.\n",
            "-- But a funeral-parlour operator or other small business with three phone lines and just 15 minutes in long-distance calls would see their phone bill rise about $13, to $170.\n",
            "\"This is the single best day that business and residential customers have had since the (1984) breakup of AT&amp;T,\" said FCC Chairman Reed Hundt.\n",
            "\"We are not raising local rates. We are not making it a necessity to raise local rates,\" he added. \"Long-distance prices are going down.\"\n",
            "But BellSouth Corp. warned that the rules would lead to higher local rates. It and other Bells said the FCC went too far in ordering cuts in the $23 billion that long-distance carriers pay for access to their networks each year.\n",
            "AT&amp;T Corp. called the plan a \"good compromise.\" But No. 2 long-distance carrier MCI Communications Corp. said the FCC did not cut access charges enough. The carriers have vowed to pass on rate reductions to their customers.\n",
            "Wall Street analysts, meanwhile, disputed the impact on Baby Bell and long-distance phone stocks.\n",
            "The overhaul, in particular, will:\n",
            "-- Keep the monthly \"subscriber line charge\" customers pay the local phone company at $3.50.\n",
            "-- Boost the line charge for household customers with more than one line to $5 a month per additional line from $3.50, and to more than $7.50 from $6 for multi-line businesses.\n",
            "Further increases will be capped at $9. But the average is expected to be below that ceiling. The average residential fee is expected to be no more than $7.60.\n",

            "-- Cut by $1.7 billion the $23 billion in annual charges long-distance carriers pay local companies to access their networks, effective July 1.\n",
            "-- Reduce access charges by a total of $18.5 billion over the five years.\n",
            "In a move that broke a logjam at the FCC, AT&amp;T promised to pass on the access-charge reductions to customers through long-distance price cuts of 5 percent to 15 percent. Other long-distance carriers have signalled they will follow suit.\n",
            "Debra Berlyn of the Competition Policy Institute, a consumer group, praised the FCC \"for its resolve to avoid any increase\" in basic local phone rates.\n",
            "But few carriers were happy with the plan -- possibly a sign that the FCC had achieved the balance it was seeking.\n",

            "Australian Treasurer Peter Costello on Wednesday announced the biggest financial reforms the country has seen since 1983, loosening restrictions on bank and life office mergers and foreign takeovers of banks.\n",
            "But Costello stopped short of allowing mergers between Australia's big four banks -- Westpac, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), National Australia Bank (NAB) and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.\n",
            "\"Today I announce the 'Six Pillars' policy is abolished,\" Costello told a news conference.\n",

            "\"The Treasurer will retain powers to reject mergers under relevant banking and insurance laws,\" said Costello, adding the major domestic banks would not be allowed to merge at this time.\n",
            "\"This will be reviewed when the government is satisfied that competition from new and established participants in the financial industry...has increased sufficiently to allow such mergers to be considered,\" he said.\n",

            "In contrast, NAB and Commonwealth Bank shares both rose as the market decided that they could fall prey to foreign predators. NAB had been seen as likely to mount a bid for Westpac and its price rise was also seen as a sign of relief that no such bid would happen.\n",

            "\"It can move off zero, but we won't allow it to go to sustantial foreign ownership,\" Costello said.\n",
            "\"We certainly would not allow it go as high as foreign ownership in the print media,\" Costello said. Foreign ownership of the print media was currently around 60 percent.\n",
            "Costello was responding to a government-appointed inquiry into the Australian financial system, which released its report on Wednesday recommending the biggest reforms in Australian financial industry since 1983, when the dollar was floated.\n",
            "Further deregulation followed in 1984, when the government first allowed foreign banks to enter Australia.\n",

            "They said the outcome of Friday's crucial Conrail shareholder vote, already considered a tight race before Norfolk Southern disclosed its effort, is now even closer.\n",
            "Norfolk Southern is \"trying to win over any uncommitted shareholder they can find,\" said Thom Brown, managing director of investment firm Rutherford, Brown and Catherwood Inc.  \n",
            "Conrail needs shareholder support in order to proceed with the planned cash and stock CSX deal.  The railroad is asking investors to waive a Pennsylvania law that would essentially require CSX to pay for Conrail in cash.\n",
            "Conrail has rejected Norfolk Southern's $10.3 billion cash bid in favor of the CSX transaction.\n",
            "Late Monday, Norfolk Southern launched a new attack on the Conrail-CSX deal, telling Conrail shareholders it would buy 9.9 percent of Conrail shares for $115 each if they defeated Friday's measure.  \n",
            "\"It might have some influence on (the shareholders), but it looks to me like it may be too late.  This has been a tough battle for Norfolk Southern,\" Brown said.\n",

            "Although some analysts had speculated that the plan disclosed by Norfolk Southern could prompt Conrail to delay the shareholder meeting, the railroad earlier confirmed that the meeting will take place Friday.\n",
            "Norfolk Southern's offer is higher than CSX's, but a merger of the two railroads could not happen any time soon. According to its pact with CSX, Conrail would be prohibited from entering a partnership with Norfolk Southern or any other party until 1999.  Norfolk Southern challenged the exclusivity pact in court, but a federal judge last week upheld the terms of the Conrail-CSX merger.\n",
            "Analysts said that the latest move by Norfolk Southern is an effort to convince shareholders that it is willing to take the risk of buying a stake in Conrail even though it would be prohibited from buying the railroad for two years.\n",

            "The 9.9 percent investment is the maximum amount of Conrail stock that Norfolk Southern can purchase without triggering Conrail's poison pill anti-takeover defense.\n",
            "\"We will move without delay on our tender offer,\" said Norfolk Southern spokesman Robert Fort.  \n",
            "The formal process was not expected to begin until later in the week when Conrail released final vote results.\n",
            "Once it buys the stake, both Norfolk Southern and CSX will hold sizable investments in Conrail without any imminent opportunity to buy the rest of the company.\n",
            "CSX, which bought 19.9 percent of Conrail in November as part of the planned friendly deal, needs to win approval of Conrail shareholders to proceed with the cash and stock transaction. Many shareholders favor Norfolk Southern's $10.3 billion cash offer, which has been rejected by Conrail.  \n",
            "Under its pact with CSX, Conrail is prohibited from merging with another company until 1999.\n",
            "\"Right now, it's a standoff,\" said one Wall Street trader.\n",
            "Conrail has vowed to convince shareholders that the proposed transaction with CSX is a better fit than the Norfolk Southern offer and plans to schedule another shareholder vote. No meeting date has been set yet.\n",
            "\"The next step in the strategy hasn't been determined. I don't think that there's any rush. We're not going anywhere,\" said a source close to the situation.  \n",
            "But Conrail apparently plans to keep a low profile for the next few days. Sources said the railroad has cancelled a traditional meeting with analysts to discuss fourth quarter earnings, due to be released Wednesday.\n",
            "Meanwhile, speculation abounds about the eventual outcome of the three-way battle. Wall Street analysts and traders have theorized that CSX may be forced to sweeten its offer for Conrail, despite repeated statements from CSX that no higher bid is forthcoming.\n",
            "And other experts speculate Conrail's board may pursue a three-way deal among the railroads at some point, especially if Conrail's stock price erodes from current levels of about $103 per share.\n",

            "Like her boss, Chief Operating Officer John Walter, McGovern has made a reputation in a different area but will bring a fresh approach, analysts said Monday.\n",
            "\"Gail is very experienced, but her experience is on the business side, and AT&amp;T is facing the bigger challenges on the consumer side,\" said Richard Klugman of brokerage PaineWebber.\n",
            "McGovern, 44, was named to succeed Joseph Nacchio, who is leaving AT&amp;T to join Qwest Communications Corp., a small telecommunications company in Denver, as chief executive.\n",
            "She said in an interview Monday that her top priority would be to improve revenue growth and to retain customers.\n",
            "\"I can tell you that focusing on reducing churn will be a top priority in 1997,\" she said in an interview.\n",
            "As the most senior woman AT&amp;T has ever employed, McGovern will be responsible for more than half the company's revenues.\n",
            "She expects to apply the same packaging of services to suit consumer customers that she has done in the business market. A single bill for a variety of services will help show the simplicity of offerings, she said.\n",
            "\"Billing is an essential ingredient,\" McGovern said.\n",
            "AT&amp;T, based in Basking Ridge, N.J., has seen its market share in the $80-billion-a-year long-distance market dwindle from a near-monopoly when a federal judge ordered its divestiture in 1984 to around 55 percent today, according to analysts' estimates.\n",
            "Apart from MCI Communications Corp. and Sprint Corp., AT&amp;T has recently faced competition from a host of small yet aggressive long-distance companies like LCI International Inc. and Excel Communications Inc..\n",
            "AT&amp;T has been able to attract consumer customers, at a cost, but has had trouble retaining them.\n",
            "Analysts who have met her had little doubt McGovern would be up to the task, after winning back major corporate contracts, including IBM Corp., McGraw-Hill Cos. Inc. and Textron Inc..\n",
            "\"She's very bright and very quick,\" said Richard Toole of brokers Merrill Lynch and Co. She has fewer rough edges than Nacchio. Joe was unique, and streetwise, but could be a little brutal,\" he said.\n",
            "Walter, who was appointed as chief operating officer in October, takes over from Robert Allen as chief executive in May at AT&amp;T's shareholders meeting. McGovern's appointment was his first visible mark on AT&amp;T.\n",
            "\"I see his hands on this promotion, though she was a star to begin with,\" Toole said.\n",
            "In the interview, McGovern said tying in satellite TV services and other forms of marketing was a great way of reaching new markets.\n",
            "AT&amp;T has a stake in Hughes Electronic Corp.'s DirecTV direct broadcast satellite venture, and in November set a deal with Shaklee Corp. under which their 500 sales representatives will talk to potential customers about AT&amp;T services.\n",

            "Former magazine editor and historian Bao Zunxin said he had written to the National People's Congress, or parliament, last week to push for tougher anti-corruption laws.\n",
            "Legislation was needed to force more openness and fuller disclosure of officials' private assets and existing laws were inadequate to cope with endemic graft, the 58-year-old dissident said in a telephone interview.\n",
            "\"Without an end to corruption, there will not be a day of peace in our country,\" Bao wrote in his letter, a copy of which was faxed to news agencies by the Information Centre of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China.\n",
            "\"Corruption has seeped into every level of the government, and requiring only officials above the county level to declare their property is far from enough,\" he wrote.\n",
            "Petitions to parliament, always a risky venture for China's tiny band of dissidents, have in the past been either greeted with stony silence or followed by the detention of signatories.\n",
            "Bao, who spent more than three years in prison for his role in the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations that were bloodily crushed by the army, said he could not guess what the reaction to his letter would be but it was impossible to be optimistic.\n",
            "Public security officials took Bao from his Beijing home in July for a week-long \"tour\" to Qingdao in eastern China after discovering he had granted an interview to a French reporter, he said.\n",
            "Some dissidents see demands for action against corruption as a rallying call that can strike a chord among a populace bitter at the wealth and privilege enjoyed by some senior officials.\n",
            "Anger at leaders and bureaucrats who use their power to amass wealth in China's new market economy helped send hundreds of thousands of Beijing residents into the streets in support of the 1989 student-led demonstrations in Tiananmen Square.\n",
            "Many Chinese say graft has since spread even more as economic reforms continue to weaken social controls and multiply profit-making opportunities for those with political clout.\n",
            "Bao's open letter follows a July appeal to parliament from leading dissident Liu Xiaobo for speedy legislation to curb corruption in the state media and to loosen the ruling Communist Party's monopoly on news.\n",
            "Beijing has repeatedly declared war on graft, calling it a scourge that threatens the very basis of communist rule, but many Chinese say the campaigns have had only limited success.\n",
            "Short-term actions such as the on-going \"Strike Hard\" anti-crime campaign were not enough to clean up China's government, Bao wrote in his letter to parliament.\n",
            "\"Corruption, especially systemic and all-pervasive corruption as in China, cannot be stopped with a short period of \"Striking Hard',\" he wrote.\n",

            "The 76-year old Pontiff, on his third visit to Prague since the fall of communism in 1989, was greeted at the airport by President Vaclav Havel and other Czech political and religious leaders.\n",
            "Some 200 schoolchildren waved yellow and white Vatican flags as the Pope slowly descended the aircraft steps and shook Havel's hand before touching a bowl of Czech earth.\n",
            "Pope John Paul said in a speech he hoped his visit would help bring about \"a fresh step forward in the ever-increasing spiritual and ethical growth\" of all Czechs.\n",
            "He paid tribute to Havel, a former dissident playwright who spent several years in jail under communism, as being \"among those who brought about the rebirth of this country\".\n",
            "The Pope is in the Czech Republic chiefly to mark the 1,000th anniversary of the death of St Adalbert, the first Czech bishop who also took the gospel to Poland.\n",
            "Adalbert, or Vojtech in Czech, is seen by Catholics as a figure of spiritual significance for Europeans of all denominations.\n",
            "\"I am certain that the heritage of Christian values of which St Adalbert was a special witness in times marked by ignorance and cruelty will not leave indifferent those who, although far from belief, have at heart the civil, cultural and spiritual roots which have so profoundly marked the history of your homeland,\" the Pope said.\n",
            "He also paid tribute to late Czech Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek, who for 40 years championed religious freedom in communist Czechoslovakia and died in 1992.\n",
            "\"He will certainly be rejoicing in heaven to see me return among his people...History is truly guided by the almighty hand of God,\" he said.\n",
            "Havel said in his speech that Adalbert cherished a dream of European spiritual unity and saw his Czech homeland as part of the Christian community of the continent.\n",
            "\"This community was to be based on a spiritual and moral renewal and on readiness to embrace common values -- which is needed today just as it was then,\" Havel said.\n",
            "The president said the martyred saint had left a legacy of peace, integration and unity which was shared by the many European nations commemorating his millennium.\n",
            "The Pope's last visit to the Czech Republic, in May 1995, proved controversial when he canonised Jan Sarkander, tortured to death by Protestants in 1620. Some Protestants say Sarkander was a traitor who encouraged a Catholic invasion.\n",
            "But Havel said Adalbert's tradition did not divide Czechs among themselves or with others.\n",
            "\"It unites our people across denominations and serves as a bridge linking us with our Central European neighbours as well as with other nations,\" he said.\n",
            "The Pope, whose health has been fragile in recent years, walked slowly but unassisted and stood to deliver his speech.\n",
            "He is to mark Adalbert's death with a mass for young people in the town of Hradec Kralove, some 100 km (60 miles) from Prague, on Saturday and hold another open air mass and an ecumenical service in the capital on Sunday.\n",

            "\"The cereal aisle is one of the most competitive aisles in the grocery store. As a result, to remain on the shelves, products have to meet increasingly high expectations,\" said Joseph Rutledge, a spokesman for General Mills Inc, the second largest U.S. cereal marker.  \n",
            "While cutting slow-selling products is a long-standing marketing practice, analysts and industry sources said the process has intensified.\n",
            "\"There is such intense scrunity on the grocery shelf -- what's moving and how fast is it selling -- that you are going to see a tremendous culling out of all these cereals,\" said Anne Tynion, president of North River Strategies Inc, a consumer and corporate brand consulting firm.\n",
            "In 1995, General Mills axed Hidden Treasures and Sprinkle Spangles and launched Frosted Cheerios, its most successful new cereal. Rutledge said the events were unrelated.  \n",
            "The weeding-out of stock-keeping units, or SKUs, is being done by both by cereal manufacturers and retailers, analysts said. In cereal, each variety and box-size is a separate SKU.\n",
            "\"There is evidence that companies are rationalizing their slower-moving, lower-market share SKUs,\" BT Securities analyst John O'Neil said.\n",
            "For cereal makers, the need to phase out slow-selling products has intensified with the recent cuts in retail prices, which have pressured profit margins. To make up for lost profits, cereal companies must focus attention on the best-sellers in the grocery store, analysts added.  \n",
            "Pat Browne-Riso, a spokeswoman for number-three Post Cereal, a unit of Philip Morris Cos Inc, said elimination of poor sellers is a natural process driven by consumer demand.\n",
            "\"For example, if a certain size product is preferred over another, or as new products are introduced, we would (do) our best to optimize our space on the shelf as best as possible,\" Browne-Riso said.\n",
            "For retailers, recent cutbacks in promotional spending by cereal makers -- such as offering discounts on wholesale purchases that may not be passed on entirely to consumers -- is prompting grocers to take a closer look at what is selling.  \n",

            "U.S. car giant Ford Motor Co said on Thursday it would cut 1,300 jobs at its Halewood plant near Liverpool, northwest England, or almost one third of the workforce, through a redundancy programme.\n",
            "Ford's British operations said that the Halewood plant would not build the planned new model of the Escort car, due in 1999.\n",
            "Production of the new model is likely to transfer to continental European factories in Spain and Germany.\n",
            "However, Ford held out the possibility of Halewood becoming the European source of a planned new vehicle, which is still only a concept at this stage. It added that Halewood would continue to make the current Escort model through 2000.\n",
            "\"The actions we have announced today at Halewood assembly operations give the plant a realistic future, with an exciting new vehicle in the medium term, subject to approval and performance objectives being achieved,\" said David Gorman, European vehicle operations manager for Ford.\n",
            "\"We have had to take these steps to ensure our manned capacity is in line with our forecasts for sales,\" he said.\n",
            "Local Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament David Alton told Reuters he had spoken to Ford, which said the jobs would be lost through voluntary redundancy. He said Halewood was in the running to be the European manufacturing site for a new vehicle, possibly in the family saloon range.\n",
            "\"There's some good news in what they say as well -- that they're looking at Halewood as the probable European site for a planned new vehicle,\" Alton said.\n",
            "The proposed job cuts will reduce Halewood's workforce to just over 3,000, compared with a peak of 14,000 in the 1960s.\n",
            "Management met trade union representatives on Thursday morning to discuss the cuts.\n",
            "Workers expressed anger as they entered the factory, blaming \"flexible\" British labour laws and its opt-out from the European Union's Social Chapter, which sets out minimum working conditions in other EU countries.\n",
            "\"I can give you one reason why the job cuts are here. The Social Chapter,\" said production line group leader Phil Gornall.\n",
            "\"In Germany, if Ford closes its plant there, it has to pay its people 18 months pay in compensation. In the U.K., we've got no Social Chapter, it's easier to shut us down,\" he said.\n",
            "Larry Brook of the MSF union added: \"Britain is the cheapest place to dump labour. We are fighting for the future of Halewood.\"\n",
            "Even if a new family saloon is built at Halewood from the late 1990s, the plant would still have excess capacity, car industry experts said.\n",
            "Production of the new Escort is now likely to be undertaken in Ford's plants in Valencia, Spain, and Saarlouis, Germany.\n",
            "Professor Garyl Rhys, a car industry expert at Cardiff University, said Halewood, now a model of industrial relations, was paying for the  \"bad old days\" of the 1960s and 1970s, when the British car industry had a bad strike record.\n",
            "\"Because of the problems at Halewood and a number of other car plants in Britain, there was a reluctance to use them as sources for exports...You couldn't guarantee deliveries because of interruptions to production because of strikes,\" he said.\n",
            "As a result, Halewood produced mostly for the home market.\n",

            "A statement by BT that it had formed a strategic alliance with Portugal Telecom SA was confused by the English version of a similar announcement from the Portuguese company, which added that MCI had also formed a pan American joint venture with Spain's Telefonica de Espana.\n",
            "BT, whose own statement made no reference to Telefonica, declined to comment. An MCI official in Lisbon further complicated the issue by saying the deal between MCI and Tisa, Telefonica's international arm, had been announced in \"error\".\n",
            "A BT spokeswoman said only: \"We're pleased to be announcing Portgual Telecom today. We wouldn't comment on any other rumour or speculation but we are conscious that there is a lot of interest in the future of Telefonica.\"\n",
            "The announcements of new alliances come one day before BT's shareholders vote on its ambitious 12.3 billion pound ($20 billion) merger with MCI, America's second biggest long-distance carrier, called Concert Plc.\n",
            "Investors, who are expected to back the deal despite concerns about the high price BT is paying, are likely to welcome any link up with Iberian phone groups which would create a formidable telephone network spanning Europe and the Americas.\n",
            "Portugal Telecom will now become the exclusive distributor of Concert Communications Services, telecoms services with which Concert hopes to link high-margin, multinational business clients around the globe.\n",
            "To reinforce the alliance, BT is taking a one percent and MCI a 0.5 percent stake in the $7.0 billion Portuguese company during its next stage of privatisation, expected later this year. A BT executive will be invited to take a seat on the company's board.\n",
            "Despite BT's reticence in commenting on any imminent partnership with Telefonica, the company says it does want to explore opportunities in South America, where Portugal Telecom has formed an alliance with operator Telebras in the largest telecoms market, Brazil.\n",
            "Brazil accounts for nearly 40 percent of South America's booming telecoms industry and its addition to the expanding Concert geographic jigsaw complements MCI's presence in 17 South American countries.\n",
            "BT added: \"In addition, the companies will also seek other opportunities in the $36 billion Latin American communications market which is expected to grow to over $60 billion by the year 2000.\"\n",

            "Telefonica insisted that no deal with Concert had been signed on Monday and added that it was still in talks with both Concert and AT&amp;T. Meanwhile Portugal Telecom said that it was also in negotiations with other international partners which may take a stake in the company.\n",
            "Some London analysts had expected Concert to take a  five percent stake in the Portuguese operator.\n",
            "Analysts say any link-up with Concert will herald a sea-change in the European telecoms alliance landscape and come as a blow to BT's arch rival in Europe, America's AT&amp;T.\n",

            "Any loss of the Spanish operator, which holds a 25 percent stake in Unisource, would be the latest setback for AT&amp;T which has been hoping to use the alliance as the vehicle for its European expansion.\n",
            "Analysts at SBC Warburg say an alliance between Concert and Telefonica \"makes strategic sense for all involved\".\n",

Conrail and CSX have stressed they are committed to their transaction and Norfolk Southern has said it would not accept any resolution that would value Conrail at less than its $115 per share offer.\n",
            "Wall Street analysts expressed cautious optimism about the meeting, but warned that any end to the stalemate would be difficult and lengthy. On Wednesday, Goode also said that negotiations would likely be tough.\n",
            "\"We would suggest it is the first of many meetings, but it's a step in the right direction,\" said Thomas Galvin of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, noting that East Coast railroad consolidation has been discussed for the past 10 years.\n",

            "China urged the United States on Wednesday to grant it permanent Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status, despite U.S. congressional doubts over whether Beijing will keep its promises on recovering Hong Kong.\n",
            "\"Granting China permanent MFN status is good for the healthy development of Sino-U.S. relations,\" an official with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) said.\n",
            "\"We will never change our position and attitude to the United States.\"\n",
            "Chinese hopes of winning over Washington from its annual review on renewal of MFN appeared to fade this week as visiting U.S. Congressman Jim Kolbe said China was unlikely to win permanent MFN status this year.\n",
            "\"I do not believe this year we will grant permanent MFN status to China,\" the Arizona Republican said on Tuesday.\n",
            "U.S. concerns over whether China will keep its promise to leave Hong Kong untouched after the British colony reverts to Chinese rule this year would slow Beijing's hopes, he said.\n",
            "\"We want to monitor Hong Kong for a year before we make any change,\" Kolbe told reporters in Beijing.\n",
            "President Bill Clinton would have to certify the move in June. China recovers sovereignty at midnight on June 30.\n",
            "MFN grants China the same tariff treatment accorded other U.S. trading partners.\n",
            "\"The U.S. annual review of MFN status is totally wrong,\" said an official at MOFTEC's research institute.\n",
            "\"It is a product of the Cold War,\" said the official who declined to be identified. \"Times have changed, but the United States still sticks to this view. It is unreasonable.\"\n",
            "China hailed Clinton's decision in 1995 to delink the annual renewal of MFN from China's human rights record.\n",
            "Beijing has since been pushing hard for the United States to end the whole annual review process that precedes renewal of MFN status to China and to grant permanent rights.\n",
            "\"China's attitude is clear, that these benefits should be granted mutually,\" the research institute official said.\n",
            "\"This is not some kind of special favoured treatment that they gave us. This is part of normal trade relations so it is not necessary to review it every year,\" he said.\n",
            "\"Our position is determined, you must give us this every year and do not need to review it,\" he said, adding that U.S. business groups were also opposed to the review system.\n",
            "Some U.S. senators have urged Washington to grant China permanent MFN status on grounds the annual review was a disadvantage to the United States and caused uncertainty to business.\n",
            "The doubts over Hong Kong were unlikely to interrupt a smiling campaign by Chinese leaders after President Jiang Zemin granted a rare meeting meeting to Kolbe and other members of the U.S. House of Representatives to try to boost ties with the American Congress.\n",

            "Computer, give me $20 bucks.\n",
            "Such a demand enters the realm of possibility with the introduction Monday of a device that turns a personal computer into an automated-teller machine capable of dispensing card-based electronic cash, marking a new step in PC-based home banking.\n",
            "Fischer International Systems Corp said its $60 device can be inserted into the floppy disk drive of any PC, enabling it to read \"smart cards,\" a new type of plastic credit-card that can perform electronic cash transactions and store bank account balances.  \n",
            "Already gaining popularity in Europe to pay for store purchases and streetside telephone calls, the \"smart card\" is beginning to take hold in the United States as a replacement for cash used in ordinary purchases like grocery shopping.\n",
            "By enabling PCs to securely dispense money, the device may provide a major stimulus to home banking by empowering consumers to perform financial transactions that now require a visit to a bank branch or an automated teller machine.\n",
            "\"What's been missing is a low-cost, easy-to-use 'bridge' between smart cards and personal computers,\" Fischer President and Chief Executive Michael Battaglia said.  \n",
            "Smarty, as the product is known, is a slim piece of hardware that inserts into a personal computer's 3.5 inch floppy disk reader, allowing the machine to link via the Internet to banks or retail outlets.\n",
            "The product is unique because Fischer holds key patents for smart card readers inserted into 3.5 inch floppy drives -- making Smarty the most readily adaptable card reader for the 200 million personal computers now in use, company officials said.  \n",
            "The device, which can be inserted into home or office personal computers or into a laptop computer when traveling, will enable consumers to make wider use of banking cards for purchases, replacing the need to carry loose bills and coins.\n",
            "As such, the product could be a boon to PC-based home banking, permitting full-scale transactions instead of the more limited functions now available, like electronic balancing of checkbooks, financial investment tracking or tax return filing.  \n",
            "Fischer officials said they are working with several major U.S. and European financial services firms to spur use of the devices in a variety of business and consumer applications, including home banking over the Internet.\n",
            "In addition, Art Burton, Fischer's vice president of sales and marketing said the company is in talks with top providers of home banking software like Intuit Inc. and Microsoft Corp. to link Smarty to their software.\n",
            "\"We have had some discussions at various stages with the primary providers of home banking software,\" Burton said. \"We are also working with individual banks.\"  \n",
            "Burton said the PC-based Smarty product will be offered later this year to consumers participating in a trial of smart card technology on the Upper West Side of New York City by a group led by MasterCard, Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank.\n",
            "In addition, Fischer said it has received initial Smarty orders from the Bank of America and Wells Fargo Bank, for pilot testing by bank employees.\n",
            "Orders for demonstration models have also come from the U.S.-based credit card consortium Visa, U.K.-based Mondex International and Sweden's Telia Group.  \n",
            "Smart cards contain an embedded microchip capable of storing more than four million bytes of computer data, or dozens of pages of information -- far more than existing magnetic-strip credit cards that hold just 40 characters or so.\n",
            "The new financial data format can act as a one-stop shopping card storing electronic cash, a collection of credit cards, and other personal information including several forms of identification to prevent fraud.  \n",
            "While slow to catch on in the United States, smart cards have grown popular in Europe and Asia, where millions are now used by banks and credit card concerns as a means of storing digital cash, by phone companies as long-distance calling cards, or in healthcare to carry details of an individual's medical history.\n",
            "Fischer, with annual revenues of about $20 million, is solely owned by Addison Fischer, its chairman and a former professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  \n",
            "Addison Fischer is considered one of the world's leading experts on computer security. He was one of the founders and principal owners of RSA Data Security Inc, developers of a popular computer security encryption technique.\n",
            "Fischer and his two partners recently sold RSA to publicly-held Security Dynamics Technologies Inc. in return for $200 million in Security Dynamics stock.  \n",
            "Fischer faces many larger competitors in the smart card reader market, including France's Gemplus, U.S.-based Schlumberger Ltd and VeriFone Inc ;, Germany' Siemens AG and Philips Electronics NV of the Netherlands.\n",
            "But these rival machines take the form of bulky computer attachments or standalone-terminals priced between $80 and $300.\n",
            "By contrast, Fischer's floppy-insert method will be priced at $60 initially, with prices expected to fall below $40 as volumes increase in the coming year, making it an affordable option for consumers, Burton said.\n",
            "Asked if the company may be considering an initial public stock offering, Burton said that, \"It is firmly in our plans, but we are talking long-term -- within the next year -- not short-range.\"\n",
            "He said Fischer plans to make another major product announcement in the spring of a related computer security technology before it decides whether to move ahead with any possible sale of the company's shares to the public.\n",

            "Nextwave, an unknown in the industry until it began bidding in 1996's C-band Personal Communications Services (PCS) auctions, has spent a staggering $4.7 billion on wireless licenses for the third largest network in the U.S.\n",
            "\"We expect to file an amended S1 to the SEC in the next couple of weeks,\" said a source close to the company.\n",
            "The company planned to go public last summer, but after a series of delays finally came to a parting with lead manager Merrill Lynch in the fall. It must now amend the S1 document it sent to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n",
            "Revised documents are not yet finalised, but Smith Barney and Lehman Brothers are set to be co-lead managers of the $200 million equity offering and CIBC Wood Gundy is leading the $300 million debt offering, the source said.\n",
            "Nextwave declined to comment ahead of the re-filing, and the source declined to be identified.\n",
            "Nextwave's total outlay may top $8 billion, when the $3-3.5 billion cost to build the network is included.\n",
            "The build-out is covered by $1.4 billion in unconditional vendor financing from companies such as Lucent Technologies Inc and Hughes Networks Systems, and another $2.1 billion in conditional vendor financing.\n",
            "\"The cost of the system is, as you can see, fully funded,\" the source said.\n",
            "Some analysts have been spooked by the huge debt Nextwave is taking on and see the wireless market as being dangerously overcrowded already. Nextwave, however, is sanguine.\n",
            "\"The company has pre-sold 35 billion network minutes of use. To put it in perspective, that is equal to the entire U.S. cellular industry's 1994 traffic,\" the source said.\n",
            "While Nextwave has huge debts, it will not incur the massive advertising, marketing and customer acquisition costs incurred by its clients and their rivals as they duel in the market place for fickle customers.\n",
            "Nextwave sees its success being backed by the 30 percent plus growth in U.S. wireless usage, and the low costs to get its retail customers into that market.\n",
            "The company has 21 customers, headed by MCI Communications Corp, which in August entered a 10-year agreement to take 10 billion minutes of use on the network.\n",
            "Nextwave is essentially offering off-the-shelf digital wireless service to any reseller that could want it.\n",
            "These already include long distance and local telephone firms who need wireless to bundle with their wired offerings, other wireless firms which have holes in their own license coverage and electric utilities who see a future in telecom.\n",
            "But potential users could embrace any firm with a strong brand and market presences.\n",
            "These could include retailers like Wal Mart Stores Inc which already sell consumer telecom devices, or companies like Walt Disney Co if it decided to offer a kids phone service under its brand name, the source said.\n",
            "Nextwave shareholders include Qualcomm Inc -- the inventor of the digital technology CDMA that is used on the network -- Sony Corp , NTT Corp, and Korea Electric Power Corp, plus institutions like ING Capital, Triumph Capital and Kingdon Capital.\n",
            "The foreign ownership is 22 percent. No shareholder has more than five percent of the company.\n",
            "Nextwave says doubters should judged it by the quality of its backers.\n",
            "\"Look at the names of the companies allied with us. Why would you put up the money unless you knew it would work? You have more than your reputation on the line,\" the source said.\n",

            "Vodafone Group, Britain's biggest mobile telephone group, raised headline annual profits by 13.5 percent on Tuesday and said it was plotting to overhaul its distribution strategy to kick-start sluggish market growth.\n",
            "Vodafone, which boasts more than four million customers worldwide, lifted pre-tax profits to 539 million pounds ($880.8 million) -- the top-end of analyst expectations -- including gains from disposals.\n",
            "Turnover grew 25 percent to 1.749 billion pounds and dividends rose 20 percent to 4.81p.\n",
            "A maiden operating profit from its international operations of 10.5 million pounds helped boost profits and analysts expect overseas investments to take up the reins of future group earnings amid increasing competition and price cuts at home.\n",
            "Vodafone's chief executive Chris Gent told Reuters in an interview that subscriber growth in Britian was likely to continue to slow this year -- and Vodafone might cut tariffs next year to help attract new customers.\n",
            "Vodafone last reduced tariffs around two years ago. But since then, its biggest purely digital rival -- Orange Plc -- has rolled out its network and the smallest operator in Britain, One 2 One, will also soon have a national network.\n",
            "\"I can see it (price cuts) happening again in the summer or autumn of 1998,\" Gent said.\n",
            "Vodafone also plans to unveil new distribution plans next month, including rationalising its 12 brands under one or two names and introducing a unified billing system to help win fresh subscribers, Gent told Reuters.\n",
            "One 2 One, jointly owned by Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc and U S West Inc, highlighted cut-throat competition in the market by repackaging tariffs last month -- and prompted concerns that Britain is ripe for a rash of price cuts.\n",
            "Mobile telephone penetration is currently stuck around 13 percent in Britain, compared to around five percent in France, 7.5 percent in Germany and the Netherlands -- and a hefty 29 percent in Sweden.\n",
            "Gent, who is hoping that British penetration will rise to 15 percent next year, expects the group to win only 350,000 to 400,000 net new subscribers this year, a touch lower than last year's 415,000 level.\n",
            "\"I suspect this year will be similar to last year -- perhaps a little bit down but not much,\" he said, adding: \"I believe we'll see accelerated growth in the UK once we get beyond 15 percent penetration.\"\n",
            "Last year already saw subscriber growth levels fall  34 percent from 1995/96 levels. Analysts note that Finland, which has almost three times the British penetration levels, is growing faster in a quarter than Britain did in the whole of last year.\n",
            "But broker SBC Warburg adds: \"In our view, renewed growth is a question of 'when' rather than 'if'.\"\n",
            "Gent puts down unenthusiastic growth to fewer incentives to win customers and a high level of churn -- when subscribers end contracts -- while customers migrate from its older analogue network to its digital services.\n",
            "Vodafone has around 1.3 million customers on its analogue network and some 1.6 million digital subscribers.\n",
            "The company saw its market share slip 1.5 percent to 40 percent and the key average revenue per subscriber figure -- the amount of profit the company makes on each of its customers -- fell to 427 pounds from 481 pounds.\n",
            "Vodafone is now growing faster internationally than in Britain and Gent expects 650,000 new customers to take up its international affiliates' services this year.\n",
            "Brokers Lehman Brothers expects overseas interests to contribute 279 million pounds by 1999/2000 -- and analysts expect Vodafone's shares, trading unchanged at 271.5p on Tuesday -- to start reflecting this value over the next nine months.\n",
            "Although Vodafone said it was not actively seeking new licences, it will consider acquisition opportunities.\n",

            "Bain told Reuters in an interview following publication of results that showed a sharp fall in 1996 profits: \"We are poised for a period of growth from the base we have put in place.\" He added, \"The company is well placed to move ahead in 1997 and future years, although the extent of that does depend on some factors outside our control,\" including exchange rates and economic trends.  \n",
            "Bain said he felt now was the right time to stand down as chief executive after 6-1/2 years, and added that he hoped to take up other directorships and chairmanships.\n",
            "\"We agreed at the end of last year that this would be a good time to go,\" Bain said.\n",
            "He said he would continue to be available to assist Coats Viyella. Bain said his successor, former McKechnie Plc chief executive Michael Ost, \"has a very good track record, and he did not expect him to change the group's strategy.  \n",
            "\"This year's results, in difficult circumstances, are exactly in line with expectations and the trading statement that we made at the end of last year,\" said Bain. \"Underlying profit is down by seven percent, which is a tad disappointing, but given the state of this industry that certainly would augur well in (comparison with) our peer group.\"\n",
            "Bain said cost savings from the group's reorganisation, which led to charges of 54.9 million stg against 1996 profits, were flowing through faster than expected. Savings in 1996 totalled 12 million pounds against a prediction of 10 million stg.  \n",
            "Bain said he was \"confident\" that savings of at least 35 million stg would be achieved in 1998.\n",
            "He highlighted the performance of the group's home furnishings division, where operating profits rose 42 percent to 12.5 mllion stg, and the continued strength of fashion retail, which he said had built profits to 13.1 million stg in 1996 from around 2.0 million over the past five years.\n",
            "But he said the performance of clothing, where profits fell 12 percent to 19.1 million stg, \"was not satisfactory.\" He said the division had been affected by disruption from restructuring, which involves relocation of a number of operations.  \n",
            "Bain said he was confident management \"is doing the right things to secure greater profits into the future, but it is taking us a bit longer than anticipated.\" He added that group was looking for a \"significant improvement\" on the division's profit margins of between three and four percent.\n",
            "The core threads division, where operating profits fell 10.4 percent to 90.3 million stg, had enjoyed a stronger fourth quarter after a weak first half, Bain said.\n",

            "The bidding war for Conrail Inc. appears to be drawing to a close, but big legal and regulatory battles are right around the corner.\n",
            "Industry analysts said Friday rival bidders CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. were unlikely to offer much more for Philadelphia-based Conrail, but both sides will pursue the fight in court, before regulators and in the marketplace.\n",
            "\"That is the whole process that takes place over the course of 1997 -- the battle for market share as opposed to Conrail shares,\" said Anthony Hatch, analyst at NatWest Securities Corp.\n",
            "CSX, based in Richmond, Va., on Thursday raised its offer for Conrail to give shareholders an extra $870 million in a friendly cash-and-stock merger. Based on Friday's stock activity, the deal is worth $9.3 billion, or about $102 per Conrail share.\n",
            "A source close to CSX told Reuters on Thursday that CSX and Conrail hoped the revised deal would end the bidding war.\n",
            "But just hours after CSX and Conrail unveiled the new terms of their planned merger, Norfolk Southern raised its all-cash offer by $500 million to about $10.5 billion, or $115 a share.\n",
            "\"If someone were to start to bid higher than this, they probably wouldn't get the economies out of the deal to make it work so the bidding war, I think, has come to the end,\" said Charles Vincent of PNC Asset Management Group.\n",
            "Although Norfolk Southern's bid has been higher throughout the two-month takeover fight, Conrail contends the union with CSX is a better strategic fit.\n",
            "Industry experts said Norfolk, Va.-based Norfolk Southern, which has the financial power to bid more than $10.5 billion, merely wants to preserve the spread between the two offers while it fights a key aspect of the Conrail-CSX pact in court.\n",
            "Norfolk Southern is challenging part of the transaction that prohibits either CSX or Conrail from seeking another merger partner before 1999.\n",
            "Some analysts and investors said that if the exclusivity provision is not thrown out after a Jan. 9 hearing in federal judge in Philadelphia, it could guarantee a victory for CSX because shareholders could not wait two years for a deal with Norfolk Southern.\n",
            "Norfolk Southern last month lost a court fight in which it challenged previous terms of the deal, including an exclusivity provision that ruled out other talks before July 1997.\n",
            "\"This is a sign that they're not going to go bananaas (with a very high offer). If they're able to break the lock-up provision, they have a good bid,\" Hatch said.\n",
            "\"It was the right thing to do to keep pressure on the (Conrail) board,\" said one takeover stock trader, referring to investors who were unhappy with the Conrail board's decision to pursue the lower of the two bids.\n",
            "The court case is expected to hinge on whether Conrail's agreeing to the extended exclusivity period is within the broad discretion allowed a board under Pennsylvania law, said Charles Yablon, a professor of corporate law at Cardozo University in New York.\n",
            "\"They're pushing the outside of the envelope and trying to take maximum advantage of the leeway that Pennsylvania law gives them,\" Yablon said. But if they can legally justify the move, CSX will probably prevail, he said.\n",
            "Few analysts were predicting the outcome, but the war was expected to continue no matter which company wins in court.\n",
            "After the court fight, the next battle site will be Washington where the losing bidder is expected to vehemently challenge the merger. The deal already is expected to face intense scrutiny from the Surface Transportation Board, the federal agency that oversees railroads.\n",
            "\"You're going to have a lot of opposition to this,\" PNC's Vincent said, citing railroads, shippers and state agencies that are expected to express their opinions when the transaction reaches the regulatory stage.\n",
            "Last week, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said it would intervene in any merger involving Conrail.\n",
            "Conrail stock fell 87.5 cents to $99.875 trading on the New York Stock Exchange. CSX stock fell 50 cents to $43.25 and Norfolk Southern shares rose $1.125 to $89.50, also on NYSE.\n",

            "Chrysler executives said they did not expect significant volumes of the new Dakotas to be available until October.\n",
            "Steven Torok, executive director of sales and marketing operations, said Chrysler was not concerned about the slide in car sales. Total car sales were down 4 percent from August 1995, and off 24 percent from July.\n",
            "August is often a seasonally weaker month than July, Torok said. Also, declines in the Dodge Stratus and Neon were partly attributable to model-year changeovers.\n",
            "\"Frankly, we saw our cars starting to firm up as the month went on, and we think we'll have a pretty good month in September,\" said Torok, adding September car sales will likely surpass those of August.\n",
            "Torok said the No. 3 automaker was pleased with the breadth of its sales performance.\n",
            "\"What we see is a very even, consistent demand pattern,\" he said. \"Consumer sentiment seems to be not euphoric but consistent.\"\n",
            "Although car sales were slightly weaker, PaineWebber analyst Michael Ward said Chrysler's total numbers were still respectable because it was up against a strong year-ago performance.\n",
            "Chrysler was the only one of the major automakers to report monthly sales on Tuesday. General Motors Corp. is scheduled to report sales Wednesday. Ward predicted it will post sales that are 4 percent to 5 percent below last year, with light trucks again offsetting weak car numbers.\n",
            "Also on Tuesday, Subaru of America, a unit of Fuji Heavy Industries, reported U.S. sales up 18 percent to 10,361. Volvo Cars of North America, a unit of AB Volvo had August sales of 7,349, down almost 1 percent.\n",

            "The advance party will be the first of up to 10,000 PLA troops who will form the Hong Kong garrison after Britain returns its last Asian colony -- a bustling capitalist outpost of 6.4 million people -- to Communist-ruled China at midnight on June 30.\n",
            "Up to 200 advance troops are expected to arrive before the handover. By that day, Britain will have phased out its garrison forces, which were once 10,000-strong in the territory.\n",

They will go through normal customs and immigration controls and then find their own way from the border to the Prince of Wales Barracks, where 28 of them will be billeted. Twelve will stay on nearby Stonecutters Island, where Britain recently closed its Tamar Naval base.\n",
            "\"The soldiers will be unarmed and are here to carry out practical preparations for the PLA to take over responsibility for the defence of Hong Kong on July 1,\" British armed forces spokesman Roger Goodwin told Reuters.\n",
            "General Zhou will be greeted at the barracks by British garrison commander, Major-General Bryan Dutton.\n",
            "\"They will be greeted with normal courtesies, handshakes and salutes,\" Goodwin said.\n",
            "\"It is in the best long-term interests of the people of Hong Kong that there should be a smooth transfer of defence responsibilities to the PLA,\" he said.\n",
            "\"The British garrison looks forward to working with the advance party to help ensure a successful transfer. The future PLA garrison inherits a proud tradition from the British Hong Kong garrison, a success story which we will do everything to help them continue.\"\n",

            "China has gone to pains in recent months to soothe those anxieties with a PLA campaign at their interim base over the border in Shenzhen, parading elite troops and stressing their qualities of virtue, discipline and high education.\n",

            "London-based international bank HSBC Holdings Plc on Monday posted a 23 percent rise in 1996 profits but chief executive John Bond said it saw a challenging year ahead amid increasing competition.\n",
            "Bond said HSBC, which gets 55 percent of its profits from the Asia-Pacific region, had a strong capital position and balance sheet, making it ready to meet that competition head-on.\n",
            "\"We see 1997 as a challenging year wherever we look whether it be Asia or the UK, the competition continues to increase,\" Bond said in an interview.\n",
            "He also told a news conference that HSBC, one of the world's largest banking groups, wanted to make insurance an international core activity.\n",
            "\"We see the biggest growth potential in the Asia-Pacific region, we are already doing it in Hong Kong and we want to roll it out to other countries,\" Bond told reporters.\n",
            "HSBC announced a 23 percent rise in pretax profits for 1996 to 4.52 billion pounds ($7.3 billion) -- around the middle of market expectations. A hefty nine pence per share rise in the annual dividend to 41 pence bettered most forecasts.\n",
            "Bond said HSBC's British unit Midland Bank would continue to grow organically, as the price of acquisitions was impossible to justify to shareholders.\n",
            "Midland, one of Britain's big four clearing banks, put in a strong performance with pretax profits up more than 20 percent and costs held to a rise of less than one percent, Bond said.\n",
            "HSBC's capital ratios were strong with tier one capital rising to 9.9 percent from 9.5 percent at the end of 1995 and Bond said he did not see surplus capital being generated.\n",
            "\"As long as we're making a respectable return on capital, we regard capital strength as an asset in our business,\" Bond said. \"It helps you with the ratings, it helps with deposits in Asia and to have a strong capital position shows in the bottom line.\"\n",
            "HSBC had a 21.3 percent return on capital in 1996 compared with 20.7 percent in 1995.\n",
            "Bond said HSBC continues to be confident over Hong Kong's transition from British to Chinese rule in July.\n",
            "Last year, HSBC was granted a licence to trade in the Chinese yuan and Bond said the bank talking to the Chinese authorities to see how this would work.\n",
            "HSBC was looking at this massive potential business opportunity in the long-term, he said.\n",
            "\"I think it will take time, of course it will, but the signs are all positive.\"\n",
            "Bond said the rise of sterling against the dollar had not had a great effect on the group's results in 1996 where the average rate for the pound against the dollar was below that of 1995.\n",
            "He said that, very roughly, for every cent the pound goes up against the dollar, the bank loses 13 million pounds in profits.\n",
            "Analysts said the results held few surprises and were not expecting to change their forecasts for 1997 in any major way.\n",
            "Nick Collier of Morgan Stanley who expects 1997 pre-tax profits of 4.94 billion pounds said he might raise this estimate marginally. John Leonard of Salomon Brothers, who has been forecasting 4.87 billion pounds, sees a change of just 50 million pounds either way.\n",
            "HSBC shares ended 30.5p lower at 1,551.5p in a generally lower bank sector.\n",

            "Macquarie Bank Ltd, Australia's largest locally-owned investment bank, posted a stronger than expected annual profit on Monday, citing bullish investment markets and a steady flow of corporate advisory work as the driving factors.\n",
            "Macquarie's net profit for the year to March 31 jumped 25.4 percent to A$116.94 million (US$88.87 million), producing a return on average shareholder funds or equity of 25.2 percent.\n",
            "Macquarie raised its annual dividend to 43 cents from 36 cents a year earlier on an earnings per share rise to 74.9 cents a share from 61 cents a share.\n",
            "Analysts had forecast a net profit of around A$105 million.\n",
            "\"All five major business groups performed well,\" Macquarie Bank managing director Allan Moss told a news conference.\n",
            "\"We were assisted by favourable market conditions, with a good level of corporate activity and fairly strong security markets,\" he said.\n",
            "The Australian stock market rose 8.7 percent over the year to March 31 and ten year bond yields fell to 8.16 percent from 8.81 percent.\n",
            "Macquarie's Corporate Advisory division, which advises companies on takeovers and mergers, benefitted from an active year of corporate plays and had 130 advisory mandates, up significantly from 1995/96.\n",
            "Among others, Macquarie advised Placer Dome Inc on its takeover of Highlands Gold Ltd and TNT on its response to Dutch postal and telecoms group KPN NV's takeover bid.\n",
            "However, Macquarie's advisory work with TNT produced the bank's one major hiccup for the year.\n",
            "One of Macquarie's most senior corporate advisory executives, Simon Hannes, was charged with insider trading last month after he allegedly bought TNT options before KPN's takeover bid and made a notional profit of A$2 million.\n",
            "Hannes, who was not working on the TNT project, allegedly had access to TNT documents at Macquarie. His lawyers have said he would be pleading not guilty.\n",
            "Moss said the Hannes matter had not affected corporate advisory work and was not expected to in the current year.\n",
            "\"Our perception is that flow of business was unaffected by the Hannes matter, because our clients recognise this matter relates to an individual and not the bank as a whole,\" Moss said.\n",
            "Meanwhile, Moss and analysts said the outlook for Macquarie was as bullish as that for the market overall, due in large part to low interest rates.\n",
            "\"With interest rates continuing to be low and perhaps going down a little bit further, there's every prospect for a reasonably good year in equity markets and we're also seeing quite a good flow in corporate activity,\" he said.\n",
            "Australian stocks have risen another eight percent since balance date, while bond markets have also strengthened further.\n",
            "Analysts said the result was stronger than expected.\n",
            "\"It's all looking fairly healthy, given the outlook for the market in general,\" said one Sydney analyst, who had forecast a A$110 million profit.\n",
            "Investors welcomed the result and talk of an eventual capital return, boosting its stock four cents to A$9.50 at the close, near its A$9.60 all-time high.\n",
            "Moss said an expected change to the way Macquarie's capital adequacy ratio was calculated was likely to boost its ratio to 16 percent in coming years from its current 13.2 percent, raising the possibility of a capital return through a share buy back or higher dividend payout ratio.\n",

            "\"I think at least four to five people were killed, including one child who died instantly,\" said a Xinjiang television station official, who declined to be identified.\n",
            "The blasts, which officials said wounded at least 60, occurred within minutes in separate parts of the city, which is the centre of Chinese control over the region and its ethnic Uighur population.\n",
            "\"People are full of fear, and the city is on high alert,\" the TV station official said.\n",
            "It was the first violence reported in Xinjiang, a region that Moslem separatists call East Turkestan, since anti-Chinese riots in Yining on February 5 and 6 left nine people dead.\n",
            "No one has claimed responsibility for Tuesday's blasts. Xinjiang, bordering Afghanistan, Pakistan and three mostly Moslem Central Asian states, was shaken last year by attacks on officials and Moslem leaders regarded as pro-Beijing.\n",

            "Urumqi residents recounted Tuesday's few minutes of terror.\n",
            "\"The Number 44 bus exploded near the agricultural bank,\" said a young Uighur woman. \"A trishaw driver was killed, he was lying on the ground covered with blood.\n",
            "\"All the windows of the bus were broken. Several minutes later, police sealed the spot. Policemen, riot police and armed police could be seen everywhere,\" she added.\n",

            "Another bomb wrecked a Number Two bus, tearing off the roof. The third explosion was on a Number 10 bus, but no details were available.\n",
            "\"When I heard the explosion, I felt as if the sky had collapsed,\" said a Uighur witness. \"Many people in a store rushed out to look. I was too terrified to go out.\n",

            "The death of Deng Xiaoping has deprived China of the architect of reform but it has left his successor in charge of an economic powerhouse in its best shape in years, economists said on Friday.\n",
            "China has attained a track record that many countries would envy -- strong economic growth, inflation in check, mounting foreign exchange reserves and a stable currency.\n",
            "\"I am optimistic on the economy,\" said Lin Qingsong, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government think tank.\n",
            "\"Overall, we are in a very good situation economically.\"\n",
            "Foreign economists agreed.\n",
            "\"It sounds awful, but Deng couldn't have died at a better time,\" said a Western economist.\n",
            "\"They (China's leaders) are in an enviable position.\"\n",
            "Deng died on Wednesday aged 92, leaving his hand-picked successor President and Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin in charge of this nation of 1.2 billion people.\n",
            "It was Deng who helped steer China on its current economic course, wrenching it from purist Marxist policies that had brought the nation to the brink of starvation and industrial collapse in 1960.\n",
            "The Deng reforms, adopted in 1978, allowed private enterprise and relied on market forces instead of Stalinist central planning.\n",
            "Eventually, the scope of change became even more sweeping, embracing stock and futures markets and breeding a new generation of \"red capitalists\" known for their millionaire lifestyles.\n",
            "China chalked up economic growth of 9.7 percent last year as it held its once troublesome inflation rate to a shade over 6 percent, well below target and down sharply from more than 14 percent in 1995.\n",
            "The nation has become a magnet for foreign investment, with many of the West's biggest corporations queuing up in the search for a share of this rapidly expanding market. In the process, China has amassed foreign currency reserves of $105 billion.\n",
            "Economists said remnants of the centrally planned economy still needed overhauling before communist leaders could rest easy.\n",
            "\"There are still many economic issues to be addressed and one of them is the state sector,\" said Lin of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.\n",
            "\"State companies need fundamental change.\"\n",
            "While many of China's private and foreign-invested companies are chalking up profits, an inefficient state sector has been unable to match those results.\n",
            "About 75 percent of China's more than 100,000 state firms lost money last year. Total losses in the state sector were up 45 percent to 69 billion yuan ($8.3 billion) in the first 10 months of last year.\n",
            "Economists said state enterprises were grossly overstaffed and needed to trim bloated payrolls while some companies would never make money and would have to be shut.\n",
            "But layoffs and bankruptcies are seen as a threat to stability and Beijing is moving ahead cautiously on this issue.\n",
            "Before surplus workers can be told to find new jobs there must be a real social safety net in a country that has neither a national pension scheme nor unemployment insurance.\n",
            "Other economists said reforms were unlikely to gather pace in the months ahead as Jiang Zemin and other communist leaders look ahead to a key party congress scheduled for later this year. The meeting will make top personnel changes and chart policies for the next five years.\n",
            "But economic analysts said China now has enough of an economic cushion that it can take its time and examine further reform carefully.\n",

            "They would also discuss how Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind would handle his next meeting with China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, likely to take place at the United Nations General Assembly session in New York later this month.\n",
            "A well-placed western diplomatic source said Hanley's talks in China had produced progress on the long-stalled and thorny issue of a joint handover ceremony when a century and a half of British rule ends, at midnight next June 30.\n",
            "\"The main thing was that he made good progress on the handover ceremony, and an announcement on this could come quite soon,\" the diplomatic source said.\n",
            "A deal on the ceremony in 291 days' time to mark this closing chapter of Britain's empire was now very close, the source said. He added that there was some hope that Britain's Prince Charles might attend.\n",

            "Progress was made on \"substantive economic issues\", although on the political front less had been achieved, he said.\n",
            "London and Beijing have long bickered over the transition, with discord over the handover ceremony once so entrenched that prospects of a joint ceremony seemed in doubt. China, infuriated by Patten's expansion of democracy in the colony, was once said to have insisted that he should not attend.\n",
            "But Lu told Hanley in Beijing he would seal the handover next year in a ceremonial handshake with Patten.\n",
            "Another obstacle has been China's plan to dissolve Hong Kong's elected Legislative council and supplant it with an appointed \"provisional legislature\", which Britain opposes.\n",
            "\"China has managed to change the tone of its approach to Hong Kong without shifting its stance on the provisional legislature,\" the diplomatic source said.\n",

            "Ikuyo said the fact there was a repeat scandal indicated there was a problem with Nomura's corporate mentality.\n",

            "The two Tabuchis, however, rejoined Nomura's board in 1995, triggering a controversy among Nomura employees because the two were regarded as a symbol of the firm's previous tainted corporate culture -- aggressively grabbing profits, even sacrificing small investors' interests.\n",

            "While life insurers have basically agreed to provide a total of 200 billion yen to help liquidate the firm, they are worried whether their contributions will be enough to cover losses resulting from the failure, they said.\n",
            "Nissan Life was ordered by the Finance Ministry to start shutting down its business on April 25. It was the first failure of a life insurance firm in Japan in the post-war period.\n",
            "Nissan Life's liabilities were estimated to have exceeded its assets by 200 billion yen.\n",
            "\"If the life insurance industry alone cannot cover the losses, we may ask for some kind of support from banks which have business ties with Nissan Mutual Life,\" one industry source said.\n",
            "He said that there were more than 100 banks and credit associations with business ties to Nissan Life.\n",
            "Koichi Yoshida, the president-designate of Sumitomo Life Insurance Co, said this week that banks should help sort out the collapse of Nissan Life.\n",
            "An official at the Life Insurance Association of Japan, which was appointed by the Finance Ministry to work out a scheme to wind up Nissan Life, said it had not yet done so as it was still examining the firm's financial situation.\n",
            "It will take three weeks or more to complete the inspection, the official said.\n",
            "Association chairman Kenjiro Hata told reporters last month it may also seek capital contributions from major clients of Nissan Life -- Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Hitachi Ltd.\n",
            "Industry sources said that Nissan Life policy holders would probably be asked to accept an increase in premiums or cuts in payments.\n",
            "They said that the most likely liquidation scheme would involve the establishment of a joint company to take over Nissan Life's assets.\n",

            "The tough job of reversing the steady decline of Snapple sales passed Thursday from Quaker Oats Co, which couldn't pull it off, to a firm that rescued the similar Mistic beverage line last year, but which is itself in transition.\n",
            "In agreeing to acquire Snapple for $300 million in cash, Triarc Cos Inc took on a task at which Quaker labored for 2-1/2 years without success. At the same time, Triarc's deal cast a new light on its pending plans to spin off its beverage and fast-food businesses, analysts said.  \n",
            "Buying Snapple could affect the proposed spinoff of Mistic, Royal Crown soft drinks and Arby's restaurants into a new company, said Triarc spokesman Martin Shea. \"We're waiting for an IRS ruling\" on the spinoff, he said.\n",
            "The effect could be a plus, said analysts, who suggested the deal shows Triarc is serious about making sense out of its jumble of assets and becoming a player in consumer brands.\n",
            "\"This new management team at Triarc is damn good,\" said Wheat First Butcher Singer food industry analyst John Maxwell.\n",
            "Based in New York, Triarc was pieced together during the anything-goes junk-bond era by Victor Posner, analysts said.  \n",
            "Posner exited when Triarc was taken over by financiers Nelson Peltz and Peter May in 1993. They have since followed a course of asset redistribution aimed at rationalizing Triarc's businesses and attracting more Wall Street attention.\n",
            "In the past four years, Triarc has gained new respect, sold 16 businesses, paid off $500 million in debt and raised $200 million in cash, Shea said.\n",
            "The firm bought Mistic for $95 million in 1995. In 1996, the juice line posted sales of $130 million. Triarc's Royal Crown soft drink line had 1996 sales of about $175 million, said Triarc beverage chief executive Michael Weinstein.  \n",
            "\"We know how to make a brand succeed,\" Weinstein said.\n",
            "That knowledge will be needed to turn around Snapple. The brand virtually invented the premium soft drink category, and it remains the market leader. But Snapple sales have declined every year since 1994. Last year, they were $551 million, down eight percent from 1995, Quaker reported.\n",
            "Quaker, the Chicago-based food giant, acquired Snapple in December 1994 near the height of its popularity for $1.8 billion, including acquisition costs. The sale price agreed to this week with Triarc will force Quaker to post a $1.4 billion one-time loss in its first quarter.  \n",
            "\"The (Snapple) investment's been a disaster\" for Quaker, said Prudential Securities food analyst John McMillin.\n",

            "Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Donald Tsang issued a strong message of stability and prosperity on Wednesday, just days before the territory's return to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30.\n",
            "In an interview with Reuters, Tsang restated the continuation of Hong Kong's independent monetary system and fixed exchange rate after July 1, warning that any change in the system that has underpinned the territory's economic success for nearly 14 years would be unwise.\n",
            "\"It would be foolhardy to make a dramatic change of that system at the change of sovereignty,\" Tsang said.\n",
            "\"For me, the continuation of the linked exchange rate is fundamental in reassuring international investors that the systems in Hong Kong will remain unchanged.\"\n",
            "Tsang, who will remain as the second most powerful bureaucrat in executive-led Hong Kong after the handover, said the maintenance of Hong Kong's prosperity was a matter of national pride for China.\n",
            "\"Hong Kong as a prosperous economic centre is a matter of great national honour for China,\" he said. \"We will continue to be prosperous, the stock market will continue to be strong, all the economic indicators are robust,\" he said.\n",
            "Apart from Hong Kong's close proximity to China's expanding economy, Tsang said four key features were responsible for the territory's past economic success and would determine its future prosperity -- rule of law, fair business practice, a corruption-free public service and the free flow of information.\n",
            "\"Our judicial system is respected, our legislative system is respected and we have a very good track record in that everyone will be treated fairly,\" Tsang said.\n",
            "\"We have a duty-free port, we have a totally convertible currency, making sure the market does not pose any impediment to foreign traders and foreign investors. So that is absolutely important, the level playing field.\"\n",
            "So is the free flow of information. Tsang said freedom of political reporting is just as important as economic reporting.\n",
            "\"If I were an investor I would want to know whether my money was sitting on a gold mine or a powder keg,\" he said.\n",
            "One of the few areas where there could be change to coincide with the sovereignty switch was management of Hong Kong's massive cash pile, which might now gain from a less conservative investment strategy.\n",
            "The Land Fund, the US$19 billion cash mountain generated from government property sales, will remain untouched in the short term.\n",
            "But the Exchange Fund holding Hong Kong's war chest of US$63.8 billion in foreign exchange reserves could tolerate a greater risk profile now that the political uncertainty associated with the transition will soon be past, Tsang said.\n",
            "But he issued a forceful reminder to those who suggest the money could be spent on infrastructure projects in southern China or on supporting new industrial sectors in Hong Kong, such as a high-technology industry.\n",
            "\"This is our money,\" he said, warning that legislative approval would be required to move funds outside the territory.\n",
            "Those who hope to pressure Tsang into supporting their ideas could be in for a battle.\n",
            "\"As financial secretary, I have always been under pressure to change things, to shell out more money for pork-barrelling politics, for subsidising industry, for subsidising transport,\" Tsang said.\n",
            "\"I have a pretty tough skin on this. I know (where) Hong Kong's longer term interests lie, in my view, and I think we have got international bodies supporting my views and the local community generally agrees with me, too.\"\n",

            "Intel Corp. will extend its reach into the networking equipment market Monday by launching two aggressively priced products aimed at speeding the use of increasingly powerful computers.\n",
            "Intel's Hillsboro, Ore.-based Internet and Communications Group (ICG) said it is introducing a networking hub to allow customers to move gradually from 10 megabits per second (Mbps) to 100 Mbps speeds.\n",
            "The Intel Express 10/100 Stackable Hub will be priced at $99 a port in some configurations -- a price it said was very competitive with traditional 100 Mbps hubs at $150 to $175 a port and the slower 10 Mbps hubs at $70 a port.\n",
            "It can be stacked up to eight units high, allowing for denser packing of networking equipment than rival's hubs.\n",
            "Intel is also launching the industry's first single chip Fast Ethernet product -- dubbed the Intel 82558 -- to support networking at speeds of 10 or 100 Mbps.\n",
            "\"We want to make network connectivity a standard part of every PC shipped,\" said ICG vice president Mark Christensen, adding that the chip reduces the cost of building Fast Ethernet networking into PCs by about 50 percent.\n",
            "The chip can be shipped directly on a personal computer's motherboard. Of the roughly 40 million new Ethernet-ready PCs shipped each year, less than 10 percent are done with motherboard implementations and Christensen said this could approach 30 to 40 percent of PCs.\n",
            "The new chip will also improve manageability features, such as remote management of the PCs over a network to simplify maintenance and upgrades. Limited samples of the 82558 are now available for manufacturers, Intel said.\n",
            "The move is Intel's second bold thrust this year in the fast-paced market dominated by Cisco Systems, 3Com Corp., and Bay Networks Inc..\n",
            "In February Intel dropped its prices nearly 40 percent on Fast Ethernet network adapters - devices which can be installed in a computer to enable them to communicate in a network at higher speeds -- a strike most directly at 3Com.\n",
            "\"3Com responded very quickly,\" Dataquest analyst John Armstrong said of Intel's February price drop, \"When they modified their adapter pricing they really rocked 3Com.\"\n",
            "\"I don't think this announcement is at the same level,\" in terms of its direct impact on the current players, Armstrong said of Monday's introductions.\n",
            "Nevertheless, Armstrong said Intel's aggressive price points could be a significant factor in accomplishing Intel's objective of boosting use of the technology.\n",
            "\"The fact they have 10/100 isn't innovative - the price point is. It will reduce the indecision level,\" he added. \"Because Intel is coming up a bit later, they have to do things that make people stand up and notice.\"\n",
            "3Com is the leader in 100-megabit hubs, based on 1996 data, with its share on some products in the category up to the high 30 percent range. Bay Networks and Hewlett- Packard Co. are also strong in the market.\n",
            "In the adapter market, analysts noted that 3Com has also provided advanced capabilities like the sort of network management features Intel is now making it possible to place directly on the PC motherboard.\n",
            "\"3Com is trying to outflank Cisco by coming at them from the desktop and in a way Intel is doing the same thing,\" Armstrong. 3Com has been facing greater pressure from both Intel and from Cisco, however.\n",
            "Just last week, 3Com said in its quarterly report that it could see slower revenue increases than the rest of the networking industry because of falling prices and weaker overall demand for networking gear.\n",
            "The stock of 3Com has fallen sharply from the low $70 range early this year to below $30 last week. It closed down $2.75 on Friday at $29.25 on the Nasdaq market.\n",
            "\"Intel is certainly a contender now,\" in networking, said Armstrong, noting that in the networking hub market, for example, they were not in the top 10 industry players in 1996 but they could burst up the charts this year.\n",
            "\"They have indicated they certainly are not stopping with these most recent product announcements,\" he said.\n",
            "Intel said it was able to support the aggressive price levels due to its expertise in silicon design and fabrication and its volume manufacturing capabilities.\n",
            "The company, the world's largest semiconductor maker, said its drive into networking, like many of its other recent industry initiatives, is aimed at selling more high powered personal computers that use its microprocessors.\n",

            "Hundreds of armed police lined the streets along the 2.5 km (1.5 mile) route to the cemetery from a military hospital, where Deng's body has lain since he died last Wednesday aged 92.\n",
            "The cortege of about 30 vehicles moved at a pace slightly faster than walking to allow thousands of mourners lining the route a last glimpse of the man who ruled China for 18 years.\n",
            "\"I have come to say goodbye to Deng Xiaoping,\" said one young man as the cavalcade moved past.\n",

            "Since his death, authorities have heightened security around the capital and especially in Tiananmen Square, the vast central space where the country will commemorate Deng with official memorial rites at the Great Hall of the People on Tuesday.\n",
            "No foreign dignitaries have been invited to the funeral. Deng's ashes will be scattered at sea.\n",
            "Deng, an early opponent of the leadership cult around his predecessor the late Chairman Mao Zedong, made clear he wanted his death to be followed by more restrained mourning than the near-hysteria that followed Mao's demise in 1976.\n",
            "Chinese sources said the military had been placed on alert to deal with potential ethnic unrest or any other threat to stability as China negotiates the delicate first days of political transition.\n",

            "Quaker said Snapple's U.S. and Canadian sales dropped 8 percent in 1996, with volume down 11 percent. Sales of its six-flavor Diet Snapple line, however, rose 23 percent in 1996.\n",
            "Chicago-based Quaker said it earned $18.1 million, or 12 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $47.8 million, or 36 cents a share, in the 1995 period. Excluding a $40.8 million pretax restructuring charge in the 1995 fourth quarter, Quaker posted a year-ago operating loss 18 cents a share.\n",

            "Merging the Hong Kong dollar with China's renminbi is impossible in the short-term and unlikely in the long-term, a panel of experts said on Monday.\n",
            "A currency merger could only be contemplated once China's capital account is fully open, allowing for free movement of financial assets in and out of the country, they told a conference organised by the Far Eastern Economic Review. They said this could take at least five years.\n",
            "\"Economically, the fact that the Renminbi is still not a fully-convertible currency also argues against a possible merging of the Hong Kong dollar with the Renminbi as Hong Kong needs a convertible currency to maintain its status as an international financial centre,\" said T.C. Chan, head of investment banking for Citibank in Hong Kong.\n",
            "But Hong Kong can still look forward to 50 years of autonomous control of its monetary system, as enshrined in agreements governing Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese control and the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini-constitution.\n",
            "\"If we set aside the political considerations, which are largely judgmental, the merging of the Hong Kong dollar with the Renminbi is simply legally not possible,\" Chan said.\n",
            "Reforming state-owned enterprises (SOEs) will be key to convertibility for China, said Andrew Freris, Bank of America managing director in Hong Kong.\n",
            "The SOEs, plagued by debt, have compromised China's banking sector. SOEs must be reformed to return integrity to China's banks, Freris told the conference.\n",
            "Only when the banking sector has reduced its exposure to the SOEs will China be able to establish a fully-functioning interbank market, which can then act as the vehicle to establish market-determined interest rates, Freris said.\n",
            "\"The market must have the capacity to allow domestic rates (to) rise far enough to attract or repel capital,\" he said. \"If you do not have fully operational market-determined interest rates, convertibility is a non-starter.\"\n",
            "Instead of anticipating the eradication of its own currency, Hong Kong should look forward to convertibility of the Chinese yuan for the opportunities it will present, Freris said.\n",
            "\"Hong Kong will be able to derive more business from fund flows in and out of China,\" he said. \"But I do think that two monetary systems will remain separate. The fact the renminbi becomes convertible will not affect the separateness of the two systems.\"\n",
            "The idea of two monetary systems co-existing within one sovereign state is not unusual, Freris argued.\n",
            "Argentina countered hyperinflation for many years by allowing its freely convertible peso to function alongside a U.S. \"dollarised\" economy.\n",

            "Al Derey, head of the Metropolitan Council of Newspaper Unions, said the action was not an act of surrender but a tactic to expose the papers to potentially huge financial losses if they do not agree to a fair contract.\n",
            "\"Our position is this strike has not ended. This is simply a new strategy to try to win a fair and decent contract from two corporate giants that don't have any souls,\" a visibly emotional Derey told a news conference.\n",
            "About 2,500 distribution, pressroom, newsroom and mailroom workers walked off their jobs at the Detroit Free Press and Detroit News in July 1995 after contract talks collapsed.\n",
            "The papers are editorially indepdendent and have separate owners but have been published under a joint operating agreement since 1989.\n",
            "Knight-Ridder Inc. owns the Free Press. The News is owned by Gannett Co. Inc..\n",
            "A representative from Detroit Newspapers Inc, the joint operating agency, could not be reached for comment.\n",
            "The papers have published every day since the strike began, although early on they only published a single joint edition. More than 400 of the original strikers have cross picket lines. The papers have hired about 1,400 replacements.\n",
            "Since the start of the strike, which has often erupted in violent confrontations between supporters and private security guards, circulation at the papers has fallen 30 percent. Advertising revenues are down between 15 percent and 20 percent.\n",
            "Derey told reporters the advertising boycott has cost the papers a combined $250 million, and 700,000 readers have dropped subscriptions. But because the newspapers \"still don't get it,\" he said the unions need to adopt a new strategy.\n",
            "If the papers reject the return-to-work offer, they could be liable for back pay from the time the offer was made if they were found to have commited unfair labor practices, said Derey. That amounts to $250,000 a day, or $1 million a year, he said.\n",
            "The action Friday is a controversial one for many union members, who are staunchly opposed to returning to work. But Derey appealed for their support.\n",
            "\"This wasn't the only strategy and it isn't the easiest, but it is the best way we've got to take on these corporate powers and get us moving again down the road to a fair contract,\" he said.\n",
            "One local labor analyst said the union's move was an acknowledgement the strike as a means of leverage has reached the point of diminishing returns. But it does force management to make some difficult decisions.\n",
            "\"What the unions are doing now is upping the legal ante,\" said Steve Babson, labor program specialist at Wayne State University's Labor Studies Center.\n",
            "If the papers do not agree to take back all of the striking workers, they could be liable for the back pay penalities if they commited unfair labor practices, a legal process that could take years to resolve, he said.\n",

            "China Thursday ordered two 747 airliners from aviation giant Boeing Co. in a multimillion dollar deal that Washington's ambassador to China said was hastened by upcoming visits by U.S. congressmen.\n",
            "The jets will be powered by engines from Pratt and Whitney, a subsidiary of United Technologies Corp., and were scheduled for delivery in 1999 to Air China, Beijing's international carrier, officials of the China Aviation Supplies Corp. said.\n",
            "Closure of the $383 million contract, which follows the purchase of three 747-400s by Air China in July last year, had been hastened by imminent visits to Beijing of about 35 U.S. congressmen, said U.S. Ambassador James Sasser.\n",
            "\"This Boeing contract is something that has been under discussion for some time,\" Sasser told reporters. \"Clearly there was an effort to try to finalise this transaction on the eve of the visit of a number of senators and congressmen.\"\n",
            "One official bipartisan delegation of around 22 congressmen is scheduled to arrive in Beijing next week for talks with Chinese officials that are expected to include touchy issues such as the Sino-U.S. trade balance and human rights.\n",
            "Relations between Washington and Beijing have long been battered by disputes over trade, Taiwan, copyright piracy and China's human rights record, but both sides say ties warmed in the latter half of 1996.\n",
            "Chinese efforts to ease Beijing's swelling and highly sensitive trade surplus with the United States were likely to provide a boost to U.S. exports to China, Sasser said.\n",
            "\"I think you will see over the coming months an effort on the part of the Chinese to make additional purchases of U.S. goods, in an effort to try to even up as much as possible the present trade deficit with the United States,\" he said.\n",
            "The United States says it has a trade deficit with China, reaching nearly $29 billion in the first nine months of last year. Beijing insists that its customs figures show a surplus in favour of the United States.\n",
            "The ambassador declined to give details of the deals likely to be agreed upon or to say which sectors might benefit most.\n",
            "Some U.S. businessmen say high-profile sales are among the earliest casualties of Sino-U.S. diplomatic spats, and Boeing has in the past hinted that it has lost deals to European archrival Airbus Industrie for political reasons.\n",
            "Boeing officials at the Thursday signing declined to comment on whether the 747 contract had been hastened by the recent thawing in cross-Pacific ties, but Arthur Abel, Regional Director for Aircraft Contracts, said the deal was heartening.\n",
            "\"We are just very encouraged and optimistic about our long-term relationship with China,\" he told Reuters.\n",
            "A Boeing statement said the two 286-passenger 747 Combis it would supply to Air China marked a strong vote of confidence from an airline that already operated 45 of Boeing's aircraft.\n",
            "Officials of the state-run China Air Supplies Corp. also welcomed the deal, although they identified the ordered aircraft as 301-seat 747-400s.\n",

            "Racal Electronics said on Tuesday the joint savings from its link-up with ITT Defence of the U.S. and partner Siemens on the UK Ministry of Defence Bowman defence contract could total 100 million stg.\n",
            "David Elsbury, Racal chief executive, said the decision to join forces with ITT's rival Crossbow consortium was due to the continued delays in the British government awarding the two billion pounds British Armed Forces communications contract. Elsbury said the group has now been assured of a decision on Bowman by March 1997.  \n",
            "He said the move by Racal and partner Siemens to link-up with their rival consortium followed news from the UK government of further delays which meant the equipment would not be in soldiers' hands until 2002.\n",
            "Both sides' bids were in danger of running to 100 million apiece on research and developments costs, said Elsbury. Racal's costs to date are running at between 30 and 50 million.\n",
            "But the decision to join forces meant  \"cost efficiency savings of 100 million\" in total. He said if the Racal, ITT, Siemens team won, they would form a joint venture and take equity. \"We're happy with the arrangements,\" said Elsbury.  \n",
            "The contract is crucial to the group's future earnings. The winner of Bowman will get an estimated two billion stg in follow-through export orders on top of the two billion contract value.\n",
            "Elsbury said the deal could create 6,500 new jobs. But there will be a rationalisation if the Bowman contract is lost.\n",
            "\"To win Bowman would be the prize. To lose Bowman, God forbid, we would still have a sizeable export market, but we would have to downsize the company.\"\n",
            "He did not specify further, but said no decision on job cuts will be made before next year.\n",

            "Boeing Co. plans to enter the airline maintenance business within the next several months as part of a drive by the jet manufacturer to develop new business opportunities, a top executive said Friday.\n",
            "\"It's one of the things we're looking at, and I'm quite sure we're going to do it,\" said Larry Clarkson, president of Boeing Enterprises, a new division of the company's commercial airplane group.\n",
            "Clarkson said in an interview the company is negotiating with several potential partners, which he declined to identify, and might begin by forming a joint venture to provide maintenance for airlines that want to use outside contractors for the business.\n",
            "The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Boeing was pushing to take over the heavy-maintenance operations of several major carriers, possibly including British Airways Plc, but Clarkson said any such transaction would be a long way off.\n",
            "\"When it comes to, say, taking over the total maintenance of a major airline, it's going to take us a while,\" Clarkson said. \"It's a very complicated thing to do.\"\n",
            "A spokeswoman for British Airways declined comment.\n",
            "Industry analysts said a move by Boeing into maintenance would make sense as a way to diversify the company's business beyond highly cyclical airplane manufacturing and weapons systems.\n",
            "\"If you can get into that business without stepping on your customer's toes I think it's a great idea,\" said Bill Whitlow of Pacific Crest Securities.\n",
            "He and other analysts said the move was a reflection of Chief Executive Officer Phil Condit's efforts to diversify Boeing while the manufacturer is enjoying a record wave of new orders.\n",
            "\"This is a reflection of Phil Condit and his more aggressive nature than his predecessor and a reflection of the internal thinking that's going on as to where best could they deploy the huge amount of cash they're going to have on hand,\" said Paul Nisbet of JSA Research.\n",
            "Boeing had $4.4 billion in cash at the end of last year, and Nisbet estimated that with the company's expected acquisition of McDonnell Douglas Corp. this year it will generate at least $1.5 billion in excess cash annually over the next several years.\n",
            "Last month Boeing Enterprises announced a $200 million joint venture with FlightSafety International to offer pilot and ground crew training. FlightSafety is a unit of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\n",
            "The Boeing unit, formed in January, also has been exploring ways to profitably use the company's massive database of world airline inventories to help carriers maintain service records.\n",
            "Boeing fell $1.75 to $100.375 on the New York Stock Exchange amid a drop of 148 points, or more than 2 percent, in the Dow Jones industrial average.\n",

            "A new osteoporosis drug reduces the risk of broken hips by 51 percent among women who already have suffered fractures caused by the debilitating bone disease, researchers said on Tuesday.\n",
            "In research presented at a medical meeting, Dennis Black of the University of California at San Francisco said results were so promising that the first part of the study was ended early so all the participants could get the drug.\n",
            "Black said 2,027 women aged 55 to 80 who previously had suffered spinal fractures due to the disease were enrolled in the study, with half of them getting the drug alendronate and half getting a placebo.\n",
            "Women taking the drug were 51 percent less likely to suffer hip fractures over a three-year period and 55 percent less likely to suffer painful new spinal fractures.\n",
            "Researchers ended the first phase of the study in October because they felt it would be unethical to continue giving patients the placebo, Black told the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.\n",
            "The second part of the research, studying the effect of the drug on 4,400 post-menopausal women with osteoporosis who had not suffered previous spinal fractures, will be completed early next year, Black said.\n",
            "Alendronate, sold under the trade name Fosamax by Merck and Co., was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in October 1995 based on a smaller study that showed it increased bone mass density.\n",
            "As of July 30 the company had generated $100 million in sales from the drug, a company spokeswoman said.\n",
            "Merck has its eye on the even more lucrative market for prevention of osteoporosis, which affects an estimated 25 million Americans, the vast majority of them post-menopausal women who suffer bone loss when their bodies stop producing estrogen.\n",
            "Currently only estrogen-based drugs are approved for prevention of osteoporosis, but Merck filed an application with the FDA in April seeking similar approval for Fosamax, a non-hormonal drug.\n",
            "Researchers at the meeting were to present evidence on Wednesday that Fosamax stops bone loss and restores bone mass at the spine and hip.\n",
            "Black noted that hip fractures are among the most debilitating symptoms of osteoporosis, leading to permanent disability in 50 percent of the cases and costing the U.S. economy $5.4 billion annually.\n",
            "He said the research showed that \"even women with advanced osteoporosis can benefit from treatment.\"\n",
            "Another researcher at the conference presented a study showing that a class of drugs known as cytokine inhibitors prevents bone loss in laboratory rats, indicating a possible new treatment for osteoporosis.\n",

            "Apple Computer Inc. reported a $708 million second-quarter loss Wednesday, reflecting a charge for the layoff of a third of its employees and weaker sales of its personal computers,\n",
            "Apple said, however, that strong sales of new, speedy PCs and laptops and lower expenses would help the company meet its goal of reporting a profit by its fiscal fourth quarter, ending in September.\n",
            "The Cupertino, Calif.-based computer company's net loss, equivalent to $5.64 a share, for the fiscal quarter ended March 28 compared with a net loss of $740 million, or $5.99 a share, in the year-ago quarter.\n",
            "Apple's loss from operations of $186 million, or $1.48 a share, was worse than the consensus industry analyst forecast of $1.22 a share, according to First Call, which tracks analyst forecasts.\n",
            "The $708 million net loss included a $155 million charge to cover the cost of layoffs and a $375 million charge for the acquisition of software developer Next Software Inc.\n",
            "Apple said, however, that it expects to see higher revenue and a reduced operating loss in the third quarter as its restructuring program takes hold. In March, the company said it would lay off 4,100 employees and reorganize operations to cut costs.\n",
            "\"Don't open champagne bottles yet, but the process seems to be working,\" said Lou Mazzucchelli, analyst at investment bank Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York.\n",
            "During the quarter, Apple introduced a jazzy laptop and a speedy desktop machine for small businesses, schools and homes. Sales of the new machines have been strong, the company said.\n",
            "\"We feel the worst is behind us and our strategy is on track,\" Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio said in a telephone conference call with analysts. He said sales will probably increase in the third quarter over the second and that the company probably will meet its goal of being profitable again by the fourth quarter.\n",
            "Still, even with better financial health, Apple faces serious problems, analysts said.\n",
            "The number of Apple computers shipped worldwide in the second quarter plunged 33 percent to 602,000 units, compared with 892,000 units in the same quarter a year ago. The drop was bigger than most analysts expected.\n",
            "Sales in Japan and Europe also were weak, Apple executives said in the conference call.\n",
            "\"I want to see a couple of positive quarters before I say they're beginning to turn the corner,\" said Michael Kwatinetz, analyst at the DMG Technology Group investment bank in New York.\n",
            "To keep costs in line with declining sales, Apple in the past year has laid off more than 5,000 employees. The company also has seen its entire management suite change in 15 months.\n",
            "The uncertainty about the company's future still is keeping customers away from the Mac aisle at stores, analysts said.\n",
            "Dataquest, which tracks PC sales worldwide, says Apple's share of the worldwide market fell to 5.2 percent last year from 7.9 percent. The slide left Apple's market share at the lowest point in three years.\n",

            "\"From 1997-2000, China is expected to open its insurance and stock market wider to foreign investment,\" the China Daily said on Sunday, quoting Ma Jixian, an official of the State Economic and Trade Commission under the cabinet.\n",
            "The pledge was contained in a unilateral action plan submitted by China to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in the Philippines last month, the newspaper said.\n",
            "Before the end of the decade, foreign insurers would have access to markets outside Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, Ma said without elaborating.\n",
            "China's insurance market was once virtually monopolised by the state-owned People's Insurance Group but the sector has gradually opened up to domestic as well as foreign competition.\n",
            "Only three foreign insurers are able to write insurance policies in China, including American International Assurance Co Ltd, a part of the American International Group Inc.\n",
            "The others are Japan's Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Co Ltd and which has a life insurance joint venture with a domestic insurer.\n",
            "Ma, one of China's representatives at the APEC summit, said foreign stock companies would be allowed to handle A shares, whose availability is still confined to native Chinese. He gave no further details.\n",
            "Currently, foreign investors are restricted to buying B shares, while Chinese nationals can only buy A shares.\n",
            "In its action plan, China also pledged to cut its average import tariffs to about 15 percent from the current 23 percent.\n",
            "The tariffs would be reduced futher in subsequent years, Ma said without going into details.\n",
            "\"A majority of non-tariff measures will have been abolished by 2010 and all those incompatible with World Trade Organisation rules will have been erased by 2020,\" Ma said.\n",
            "China has pushed to gain entry to the WTO on the favourable terms of a developing nation, but Western countries, particularly the United States, have insisted its economy is too big for such preferential treatment.\n",
            "According to the action plan, China would allow foreign banks to open more operational outfits in 24 Chinese cities and launch pilot bases where foreign banks can conduct yuan business, the newspaper said.\n",
            "In the first decade of the next century, foreign banks would be allowed to expand their presence beyond the current 24 pilot cities and more pilot bases would be available for them to conduct yuan business, it said.\n",
            "China would let overseas retailers establish more joint venture or cooperative retailing chains in areas beyond the 11 pilot cities currently allowed, the newspaper said.\n",
            "The liberalisation would cover all provincial capitals and major economic cities by the year 2010, the newspaper said, adding that foreign retailers would be free to open outlets in China by 2020.\n",

            "AT&amp;T Corp's core businesses performed better in the last quarter of 1996 after struggling during much of the year, but a new problem of rising bad debts from business customers is causing analysts some concern.\n",
            "\"The growth in traffic volumes (3.2 percent) was better than the 2.5 percent we were expecting,\" said Richard Klugman of brokers PaineWebber. \"But they are still losing market share to the tune of three percentage points a year,\" he said.\n",
            "An extra $200 million provision for uncollectible revenue dragged earnings below consensus for the fourth quarter.\n",
            "AT&amp;T's operating net was $0.76 against $0.68 in the year-earlier period and adrift of the $0.79 First Call consensus of analysts. Increased provisions will now cost $100 million each quarter.\n",
            "\"It knocks out close to four cents a share (in earnings) going forward,\" said Klugman.\n",
            "\"No one was expecting that,\" said Bette Massick, an analyst at Bear Stearns. The problem is partly poorer credit profiles at businesses, plus increased bankruptcies and bad debt.\n",
            "But breaches of contract and bankruptcies among the mushrooming number of long distance service resellers who use AT&amp;T's network is clearly a major problem too, analysts say.\n",
            "\"When a reseller goes out of business the network provider takes the hit,\" said Klugman.\n",
            "AT&amp;T and other network providers are required by Federal Communication Commission rules to do business with resellers, who then compete with them for customers.\n",
            "AT&amp;T said it had lowered customer turnover -- or churn -- and had maintained its market share in business services.\n",
            "\"Volumes in long distance was better and revenue growth better than we expected,\" said Massick.\n",
            "However she said she was lowering her earnings estimate for the company for 1997 to $3.20 from $3.65 per share.\n",

            "The stock slid $2 to $39.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was the second most-active issue. MCI Communications Corp. lost 75 cents to $33.125 on Nasdaq and Sprint Corp. also lost 75 cents to $39.25 on the NYSE in sympathy.\n",
            "\"It is in AT&amp;T's court,\" said analyst Barry Sine of SBC Warburg. \"The more they spend on marketing their new services for the long term, the lower 1997's results will be.\"\n",
            "The market was spooked by Salomon Brothers analyst Jack Grubman, who cited higher spending and greater competition in the telecommunications market. He cut his estimate of AT&amp;T's 1997 earnings to $3.00 per share from $3.60 and his 1998 estimate to $3.25 per share from $3.80.\n",
            "Fourth-quarter 1996 earnings per share will be closer to 70 cents than the previously forecast of 78 cents, he added.\n",

            "\"Salomon's number is for a dire outcome,\" said Frank Governali of First Boston, who expects AT&amp;T to earn $3.25 to $3.45 a share for 1997.\n",

            "\"We have not yet determined what 1997 will bring, but it is safe to say we do not agree with the more pessimistic comments,\" said a source at AT&amp;T who declined to be identified.\n",
            "The source acknowledged the company was facing stiff competition from traditional rivals like MCI, as well as small aggressive competitors and soon, the regional Bells.\n",
            "Governali said AT&amp;T had a choice to make: \"Either to run the business for 1997, in which case they could make $3.60 per share, or to position itself for the long-term, in which case there is no way they can\" earn that amount.\n",
            "Analysts say the whole industry faces the same dilemma.\n",
            "The Telecommunications Act of 1996 will release the regional Bells into the long distance market place this year, on top of a horde of tiny rivals that have been nibbling away at the customers of the big three.\n",
            "Though AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint can enter the local phone market, they will have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to advertise their services, push their brand names and build network facilities to key business customers.\n",
            "Grubman's research note said he believed AT&amp;T was losing hundreds of millions of dollars on its popular Worldnet Internet access service too, because of high costs.\n",
            "Analysts said MCI and Sprint have already bitten the bullet by warning analysts of increased spending, but AT&amp;T had not done so.\n",
            "\"Sprint and MCI have already done it. MCI's merger with British Telecommunications Plc is a tacit admission of that fact (that you need very deep pockets to succeed),\" Governali said.\n",
            "SBC Warburg's Sine said MCI told analysts it would spend an extra $200 million to $300 million this year on marketing, but the stock was not hit because it is supported by the value of the planned British Telecom merger, announced in November.\n",
            "Separately, AT&amp;T said it won a $341 million contract from Delta Air Lines Inc. for worldwide voice and data services.\n",
            "The seven-year contract extends an existing agreement between the two under which AT&amp;T provides a virtual network for the airline. The new contract will provide Delta with intelligent call-processing to reduce reservation backlogs.\n",
            "In another announcement, a partner in an African consortium that is bidding to take over Ivory Coast's Ci-Telcom telephone company said AT&amp;T agreed to buy a 35 percent stake in the consortium, Africa Bell.\n",
            "Ci-Telcom, with an estimated value of between $200 million to $350 million, is the most important company on Ivory Coast's privatisation programme.\n",

            "Two of Japan's most troubled banks took action Tuesday to end their long-running financial woes, with one announcing a radical restructuring and the other finding a merger partner.\n",
            "The moves are seen as just the beginning of a drive by the the indebted banking industry to get ready for Japan's emerging \"Big Bang\" era of financial deregulation.\n",
            "Nippon Credit Bank Ltd, one of three long-term credit banks in Japan, announced that it would cease overseas operations, sell off its Tokyo headquarters as well as other property and write off bad loans totalling 460 billion yen ($3.7 billion).\n",
            "Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, Japan's 10th-largest commercial bank, meanwhile, said it will merge with the smaller Hokkaido Bank Ltd and cease overseas operations to become a \"super-regional\" bank.\n",
            "NCB said the restructuring will boost earnings by 50 billion yen ($403 million) over the next five years. It hopes to gain 67 billion yen ($540 million) from the real estate sales and will also eliminate 600 jobs to cut costs.\n",
            "Despite the moves, NCB president Hiroshi Kubota told a news conference that he cannot rule out the possibility of a tie-up or merger with other banks in the future.\n",
            "Earlier on Tuesday, NCB put three non-bank financial affiliates under bankruptcy protection.\n",
            "As a long-term credit bank, NCB raises cash through issuing debentures rather than taking deposits.\n",
            "The Japanese government, which has spoken of the benefits of deregulation and leaving the market alone, has taken a strong hand in ensuring that NCB survives, urging other banks to accept newly floated shares to help it rebuild its capital base.\n",
            "The Ministry of Finance (MOF) also said it planned to use 80 billion yen ($645 million) from a special fund created to cope with bad loans from the collapse of \"jusen\" housing loan firms.\n",
            "Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka told a news conference that the capital increase and disposing of bad loans \"will substantially improve NCB's business foundation and will contribute to the stability of financial systems both at home and abroad.\"\n",
            "Financial analysts have criticised the NCB plan, saying it would further weigh down other big banks, which are themselves in far from robust financial health.\n",
            "In addition, some said the moves were too timid.\n",
            "\"The restructuring programme announced by Nippon Credit Bank is quite drastic, but when taking into account the size of its massive problem loans, the programme falls short of solving its bad loan woes,\" said Yushiro Ikuyo, first vice president of Smith Barney International Inc.\n",
            "Hokkaido Takushoku said it had no choice but to retrench, ending lofty ambitions of being a global player in the banking world.\n",
            "\"We made the decision (on the overseas pullout) believing that it was inevitable to ensure leverage in our business while promoting bad loan write-offs,\" it said in a statement.\n",
            "Hokkaido Takushoku said it and Hokkaido Bank would merge as equals by April 1998.\n",
            "Both are headquartered in Sapporo, the largest city on Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido.\n",
            "The merger will cut costs at the two banks and mean the elimination of 2,000 jobs.\n",
            "It will also help Hokkaido Takushoku face its mountain of bad debts. The bank has long been considered the most troubled of Japan's major city banks and a merger candidate.\n",
            "\"It's a step in the right direction but they are taking two banks with huge bad debt problems -- merge them together and you've got a colossal bad debt problem to deal with,\" said Brian Waterhouse, an analyst at HSBC James Capel.\n",
            "As part of the new focus it will shut down its six overseas branches in locations including New York and London and seven representative offices. It said the withdrawal from overseas operations would have only a limited impact on its business.\n",

            "PRUDENTIAL REGULATION\n",
            "* Whether to combine the functions of the four regulatory bodies currently operating into a single body that provides prudential regulation and consumer protection regulation for all financial institutions. This is the \"mega-regulator\" option.\n",
            "Currently the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) regulates banks, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission (ISC) regulates life and pension groups, the Australian Financial Institutions Commission (AFIC) regulates building societies and credit unions and the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) regulates companies generally and markets in particular.\n",

            "Future Hong Kong lawmakers on Saturday agreed on a formula to pass laws for the territory in face of mounting anger over Beijing's plans to roll back civil liberties after taking back sovereignty from Britain.\n",
            "The provisional legislature met in the Chinese city of Shenzhen, just across the border from Hong Kong, to decide the format which will enable it to pass bills, including those to dilute existing Hong Kong laws protecting civil rights.\n",
            "The China-crafted interim chamber, which Beijing intends to put in place of the present elected legislature at the handover, agreed all three required readings of proposed bills could take place before July 1.\n",
            "The bills would then be confirmed and made into laws on July 1, the local cable television station reported. Hong Kong, a British colony for more than 150 years, reverts to China at midnight on June 30.\n",
            "The move followed a heated debate this week after the territory's future leader, Tung Chee-hwa, launched plans to curb protests and foreign funding of Hong Kong political groups after the handover.\n",
            "\"Some members feel that since we have been empowered to scrutinise and to pass laws before July 1, then that power should be used before July 1,\" provisional legislator Selina Chow said.\n",
            "\"(It will) enable some absolutely essential legislation to enjoy the certainty of having been passed before July 1 so as to avoid a legal vacuum.\"\n",
            "Pro-democracy activists have threatened to sue the 60-strong provisional chamber if it passes any laws, holds meetings or opens offices on Hong Kong soil before July 1.\n",
            "Hong Kong democrats regard the interim legislature as a breach of the territory's post-handover constitution. Earlier, they launched a protest banner attached to dozens of colourful helium-filled balloons.\n",
            "\"Against the provisional legislature passing laws before July 1,\" the banner read. The protesters cheered as it floated towards China.\n",
            "Tung's proposals on civil liberties were widely expected after Beijing resolved in February to repeal or amend existing Hong Kong laws protecting freedoms and political rights. But the plan has sparked a fiery debate locally and drawn criticism from the United States.\n",
            "Hong Kong people will need police permission to demonstrate after July 1, a far cry from the current practice of merely notifying police beforehand.\n",
            "With the lawmaking formula in place, the provisional chamber is now in a position to enact Tung's plans into law. Hong Kong's 6.4 million people have been given three weeks to comment on the proposals.\n",
            "The rights issue looked sure to remain in the international spotlight after U.S. officials said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would hold talks on Monday with the leader of Hong Kong's democracy movement Martin Lee, now on a lobbying and fund-raising mission in the United States.\n",
            "But there is little to suggest that China will yield to pressure over its plans.\n",
            "Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on Friday praised the provisional legislature and its work, a local newspaper said.\n",

            "Demands for cheaper telephone services by businesses would drive liberalisation in the telecommunications markets of the APEC region, said Larry Irving, a telecommunications adviser to U.S. President Clinton\n",
            "\"The biggest advocates of change of telecommunications law aren't the United States, Australia or New Zealand, it is the business people in those countries, who want better service and lower prices,\" Irving told Reuters in an interview.  \n",
            "\"The biggest proponent is not the telecom companies, it is the industrialists, who are demanding better services and cheaper prices,\" said Irving, who is head administrator of the National Telecommunication Informational Agency (NTIA).\n",
            "\"It is becoming a competitive edge, countries cannot afford not to liberalise their telecom markets,\" said, Irving, who is attending a meeting of APEC telecommunications ministers here.\n",
            "Countries that liberalise their telecommunications markets would create more telecom-related jobs than those that retain state-owned monopolies, Irving said, citing Chile, Mexico and New Zealand as APEC countries with open  markets.  \n",
            "Irving said 400,000 jobs were created in the United States last year in telecommunications and information technology industry or about one-fifth of all new jobs in the U.S. economy.\n",
            "Chile's undersecretary of communications Gregorio San Martin Ricci said more jobs have been created in his country's telecom industry since the South American nation deregulated the market in the late 1980s.\n",
            "\"There are now nine companies providing local telehony services and six firms provide long distance calls, compared with two companies in the late 1980s, which has meant more jobs,\" San Martin told Reuters in an interview.  \n",
            "A deregulated telecom market has also made Chile more internationally competitive, the Chilean minister said on the last day of the three-day meeting of the telecom ministers of Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.\n",
            "\"Before our markets used to be so far away, because we are right down the bottom of South America but with good telecommunications our customers are now very close and distance is no longer a problem,\" San Martin said.  \n",

            "\"There is no question that it has made us more competitive, but we realised we had to open it to private investment because we could not afford to do it ourselves,\" he told Reuters in an interview.\n",

            "Talk of a merger between the Airbus European passenger plane venture and U.S. aerospace giant Lockheed Martin was premature but the two groups do have interests which would benefit from a link up, Airbus's French partner said on Saturday.\n",
            "\"It's premature,\" Aerospatiale vice president for corporate communications Patrice Kreis said when asked about a report in the London Times newspaper which said Airbus Industrie and Lockheed Martin were in merger talks.\n",
            "\"Airbus's interests and Lockheed's interests are to merge (eventually),\" he said, in the face of a pending merger by Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. The merged Boeing-McDonnell group \"want not only to dominate the market but to take it over completely,\" he said.\n",
            "But it was too early to talk about linking up Airbus with Lockheed as European aerospace and defence companies needed to consolidate among themselves, before tackling a transatlantic merger, he said. \"There's a lot of work to do,\" he added.\n",
            "Among the key steps to be taken are current moves to changing Airbus's partnership into a limited liability company. But that should occur in the context of a rationalisation of European civil and military aviation, space and weapons systems, he said.\n",
            "\"Airbus on its own will not survive. Everything is linked -- civilian aircraft, military aircraft, space and weapons systems,\" he said. The creation in the United States of titans such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing-McDonnell Douglas, which embrace all these sectors, is forcing Europe to do the same.\n",
            "The European consolidation would be through changes in capital at the parent-company level rather than cooperation on specific projects favoured in the past.\n",
            "Important steps are being taken in France in the restructuring, with a merger of state-owned Aerospatiale and combat-plane maker Dassault Aviation, and the privatisation of defence electronics firm Thomson-CSF, both due to be realised this year.\n",
            "Aerospatiale's chairman Yves Michot has said he was talking to Lockheed to collaborate with Airbus on specific projects.\n",
            "Lockheed could become a partner in the crucial Airbus project to build a 555-seater plane, the A3XX, to rival Boeing's monopoly of the large capacity segment with its 747 jumbo.\n",
            "Aerospatiale had no comment on the timing of any Lockheed decision to join the A3XX project, which has already signed up Italy's Alenia, part of the Finmecanicca group, and Saab of Sweden as potential risk-sharing partners.\n",
            "Lockheed Martin and Aerospatiale both have interests in civil and military aircraft -- Lockheed makes fuselages for Boeing passenger planes, makes large military transports, and is also a prime contractor for the U.S. new-generation F22 fighter.\n",
            "Aerospatiale makes Airbus cockpit systems and assembles the planes at its plant in Toulouse, southwestern France. It is also a key partner in the planned European Future Large Aircraft (FLA) military transport.\n",

            "Susanne Wegerhoff, a Ford spokeswoman in Brentwood, England, said the automaker will announce operating changes for the plant after a meeting scheduled for Thursday with major unions. She denied a British newspaper report that Ford was threatening to close the facility.\n",
            "\"Halewood is going to have a future. What we are going to talk about is a plan to secure a realistic future for Halewood,\" Wegerhoff said in a telephone interview.\n",
            "She declined to discuss specifics before the meeting with the Transport and General Workers union and other unions, adding that \"it is people's careers we're talking about.\"\n",
            "London's Observer newspaper reported on Saturday that Ford wanted to cut 500 jobs at Halewood and install new, more efficient work practices. The newspaper said Ford would threaten to close the plant or build its next-generation Escort elsewhere if unions fail to agree to the concessions.\n",
            "The plant, which employs 6,500 workers, produces Ford's European-designed Escort sub-compact cars. Similar in size to the U.S.-built Escort, the cars are Ford's main mid-range models in Europe, competing with Volkswagen AG's Golf and General Motors Corp.'s Opel Astra.\n",
            "The moves to restructure the Halewood plant come as Ford is struggling in Europe. In the third quarter of 1996, the latest figures available, Ford's losses in Europe climbed to $472 million from $320 million in the year-earlier period.\n",
            "Ford Chairman Alex Trotman declined to comment last week on fourth quarter and full-year 1996 European results, but said he expected a profit in Europe for the current year.\n",
            "Industry analysts consider the Halewood plant in northwestern England the least efficient of Ford's three Escort plants in Europe, including its sister facility at Dagenham in London, which also builds smaller Fiesta models, and the Saarlouis, Germany, plant.\n",
            "\"We have an issue of overcapacity, particularly in that segment of medium-sized cars,\" Wegerhoff said.\n",
            "In a meeting Friday with Wall Street analysts, Ford executives said they planned to take actions to reduce excess capacity but did not offer specifics, Burnham Securities analyst David Healy said.\n",

            "If every person in Russia and Germany turned on their televisions, that would equal the number of Chinese who have watched a primetime documentary on the life of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.\n",
            "\"There is a rather high viewership,\" said one official of China Central Television (CCTV) when asked how many of China's 1.2 billion people were watching the 12-part documentary launched with much fanfare on New Year's Day.\n",
            "He estimated the ratings at 28 percent of the estimated 800 million Chinese who have access to a television -- or 224 million people sitting in front of their screens every evening at 8.00 p.m. (1200 GMT) for the past 12 days.\n",
            "That compares with about 40 million who watch the nightly evening news -- a stultifying menu of Communist Party leaders meeting visiting heads of state or issuing political pronouncements and images of factory output successes.\n",
            "It outstrips ratings of recent popular soap operas, although it cannot match the number who watch the spectacle of song and dance that transfixes China on Lunar New Year's Eve.\n",
            "Deng Xiaoping has faced scant competition from other channels for the eyes of China's television audience.\n",
            "Usual primetime viewing offers a choice between game shows, soap operas imbued with socialist propaganda or saccharine love stories imported from Singapore or Hong Kong.\n",
            "The decision to run the series, after four years of shooting and post-production, followed a surprise, last-minute edict from China's propaganda tsars, CCTV officials said.\n",
            "Officials were unable to explain why it was necessary to wait until early December to schedule broadcast of a documentary that had been in the works for so long.\n",
            "Political analysts said the paean was aimed at stressing the importance of Deng in the year when Hong Kong will return to Beijing sovereignty under an accord he brokered, but when poor health will prevent him from attending the ceremony.\n",
            "Speculation abounds of Deng's fragility, ranging from rumours of his sudden admission to hospital in recent days to reports that he remains at home with little change in his health but no longer mentally alert.\n",
            "Deng has not been seen in public for nearly three years -- a result of his own desire to retire from the front of stage to a behind-the-scenes role, as well as his failing health, analysts say. In his last appearance he looked weak and faltering.\n",
            "CCTV's advertising department had long ago sold all space for advertisements to accompany a soap opera due to be shown in early January at the usual rates of about 70,000 yuan ($8,400) per 15 seconds when the sudden reprogramming order arrived.\n",
            "It was regarded as inappropriate to interrupt with advertising each 45-minute episode on the man whose pragmatic market policies turned a backward Stalinist state into an economic powerhouse.\n",
            "As a result, viewers have been regaled with a breathless commentary on the achievements of China's architect of reform sandwiched between 15 minutes of advertisements ranging from sanitary napkins, instant noodles and soap to pumpkin seeds, insurance, toothpaste and shampoo.\n",
            "CCTV's advertising department said it had not received any complaints from customers expecting to sell their karaoke machines or chocolate during a soap opera and instead found their products linked to a tribute to China's political boss.\n",

            "The Czech Republic's trade deficit nearly doubled in January, year-on-year, as exports stagnated, and analysts said they saw little change in the trend of the burgeoning trade shortfall.\n",
            "The Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) on Monday said the January trade deficit hit 13.6 billion crowns compared with a 7.86 billion crown deficit in January 1996.\n",
            "The CSU added that imports, led by continued strong inflows of machinery and raw materials, grew by 8.2 percent year-on-year, while exports contracted by 2.5 percent, spurred by a sharp 11.8 percent decrease in raw material exports.\n",
            "\"The figures are better than expected...the market expected above 15 billion crowns...but I don't think it will mean any change in the trade (balance's) development,\" said Petr Tomek of Zivnostenska Banka.\n",
            "The bureau did not issue a revised end-year 1996 figure for the trade balance, which hit a record 160.3 billion crowns. It has forecast the 1997 trade deficit to rise to about 215 billion crowns.\n",
            "The CSU said overall nominal imports for January firmed to 60.04 billion crowns from 55.5 billion for the same month last year, while exports totalled 46.45 billion, down from a previous 47.63 billion.\n",
            "Boris Gomez of ING Barings said that while January's trade figures were an improvement from December, where the monthly figure was 17.996 billion crowns, the beginning of the year is traditionally a period of slowing trade.\n",
            "\"We're not overly encouraged since historically the first two months of the year we usually see relatively lower deficits because of generally weaker trade flows,\" he said.\n",
            "\"We are hoping for a stabilisation of the deficit. If what happened last year when the deficit picked up pace in the second quarter, it's not good, though we are banking on import growth slowing a bit given the tight monetary environment.\"\n",
            "Last summer the central bank tightened its monetary policy, raising its discount rate one full percentage point to 10.5 percent, and minimum reserve requirements on primary deposits to 11.5 percent from 8.5 percent. Interbank money market rates up to three months in the Republic hover around 12.5 percent.\n",
            "Analysts added that the trade figures were also influenced by the strengthening of the currency, the crown, which gained some three percentage points against its dollar/mark basket in January, boosted by demand brought about by a wave of over 35 billion crowns worth crown-denominated Eurobonds.\n",
            "\"If the Bundesbank sees it policy down the road of keeping the mark relatively weak to help the economy, that's not good news for the Czechs, nor are the rumblings that the economic recovery of the EU may be slower than expected,\" Gomez said.\n",
            "CSU figures showed EU countries accounted for more than 60 percent of both imports and exports with the Czech Republic.\n",

            "The regional manager for Air France Cargo, Philippe Bour said he will meet Hong Kong government officials on Monday to explain why some leading airlines are refusing to withdraw a fuel surcharge on ex-HK air cargo.\n",
            "The imposition by airlines of an 80 Hong Kong cents a kilo fuel surcharge has caused controversy in the territory. Following complaints from the Hong Kong Shippers' Council, which also represents freight forwarders, the Civil Aviation Department (CAD) wrote warning letters asking airlines to withdraw the surcharge. Some did but Bour said Air France, Lufthansa Cargo, Swissair, Air Hong Kong and Thai Airways International have refused.\n",
            "He told Reuters, \" we are fighting with the CAD because they are saying it is totally illegal, but we don't have the same point of view. I am saying it is not a rate increase but a fuel surcharge, which is something totally different. I understand perfectly well that we are not allowed to increase the official rate without referring to the CAD, but when are talking about market rate plus a fuel surcharge we are still far below the official rate. We can play around with the market rates and the fuel surcharge will remain,\" Bour explained.\n",
            "The average rate from Hong Kong to Europe is between HK$23-24 per kilo with a fuel surcharge of 80 HK cents or 10 US cents which restores the rate to last year's level, Bour said. He said the fuel surcharge is not a blanket application, express cargo and cargo with airway bills containing the published rate is exempt.\n",
            "Bour said the argument had been referred to the French civil aviation department, which has been in touch with the Hong Kong government.\n",
            "\"Hopefully the meeting on Monday will clarify things and will be a fruitful one,\" Bour added. - Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+544 171 542 5017\n",

            "Toronto-based T. Eaton Co. Ltd., Canada's fifth largest department store chain with annual sales of C$1.67 billion ($1.22 billion), received court permission on Thursday to continue the operations of its retailing unit while negotiating a restructuring plan.\n",

            "Wal-Mart has quickly seized the lead in Canadian retailing market share, with 43 percent. Amid this onslaught, several Canadian retailers have declared bankruptcy.\n",
            "One analyst, who declined to be identified, said publicly owned Canadian retailers such as Hudson's Bay Co. and Sears Canada Inc. would be especially hard hit if a second major U.S. retailer emerged in Canada.\n",
            "\"If a U.S. guy doesn't come in, it'll be positive for Hudson's and Sears,\" he said. If not, \"that's the worst of all worlds...it makes it much tougher.\" Sears Canada is 61 percent-owned by Chicago-based Sears, Roebuck and Co..\n",

            "Anglo-Dutch publishing group Reed Elsevier Plc said on Wednesday that currency factors were likely to depress this year's earnings after the company recorded an 11 percent profit rise in 1996.\n",
            "Reed Elsevier co-chairman Nigel Stapleton told Reuters the strength of sterling would, if maintained, \"drag down\" headline earnings by five percent this year. Earnings figures for the combined businesses of Reed Elsevier are expressed in sterling.\n",
            "Pre-tax profits in 1996 rose to 805 million pounds ($1.3 billion) from 723 million on turnover from continuing operations up to 3.38 billion pounds from 3.21 billion. Share analysts had forecast profits of between 808 and 821 million pounds.\n",
            "Analysts said that the strong pound was likely to restrict earnings growth to single figures this year and they mentioned a likely profit figure of around 870 million pounds.\n",
            "Reed International Plc, the British arm of the business, proposed a two-for-one share split to take effect in May.\n",
            "London-listed Reed shares were down 18-1/2 pence to 1,155p at 1520 GMT, while Elsevier NV shares in Amsterdam dipped 1.10 guilders to 31.40.\n",
            "Analysts said the company's performance had fallen slightly short of expectations and that Reed shares had risen more than 10 percent over the last two months on bid speculation.\n",
            "For shareholders in Reed the full-year dividend was raised by 11 percent to 27.2 pence per share. Elsevier shareholders will receive 0.76 guilders per share, a 29 percent increase.\n",
            "The company noted that currency conversions meant that Elsevier results and dividends were helped in guilder terms.\n",
            "\"It's good news for Elsevier and bad for Reed,\" said co-chairman Stapleton. \"(But) the two share prices are linked so much that Elsevier should pull Reed up with it in some respects.\"\n",
            "Stapleton said the 1996 figures reflected a \"solid performance\" right across the group. They followed a four percent earnings dilution resulting from the company's 1995 consumer business divestment programme.\n",
            "Reed Elsevier sold consumer businesses, such as local newspapers, in order to focus on the provision of information in fields like science, business and the legal profession.\n",
            "Stapleton said a \"big deal\" such as Reed's $1.5 billion purchase of U.S. on-line information supplier LEXIS-NEXIS in 1994 would be \"nice but not necessary\".\n",
            "His co-chairman Herman Bruggink told analysts in Amsterdam that Lexis-Nexis was stepping up its efforts to expand outside its U.S. base and targeting Europe in particular.\n",

            "The El Nino weather pattern developing in the Pacific could damage West African cocoa crops, but the extent of any losses is hard to predict because of local weather and crop patterns, industry analysts said on Thursday.\n",
            "\"Sometimes it has effects on yields and sometimes it doesn't,\" said one crop analyst, referring to seven other El Nino events since one of the most damaging in 1976.\n",
            "On Tuesday the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said weather in the Pacific had triggered an El Nino weather pattern that would probably affect world crops.\n",
            "Cocoa futures for July contracts spiked at a new high of 1,085 stg a tonne in London trading on Thursday but long-term price effects would depend on traders' views on supply deficits into 1997/98 (Oct/Sept).\n",
            "El Nino is the name given to a reversal of ocean water circulation in the southern Pacific. The phenomenon, which scientists say is becoming more common, is generally associated with droughts in parts of Africa, Australia, Indonesia and South America.\n",
            "In more northerly countries, El Ninos can spell rain.\n",
            "El Nino cut Nigerian 1976/77 cocoa production from a possible 220,000 tonnes to around 160,000 tonnes, with Ghana's crop cut to around 330,000 tonnes from 412,000, say analysts.\n",
            "\"El Nino can cause enormous havoc. Depending on when it hits it can affect one or two years' main crop,\" one analyst told Reuters in Abidjan.\n",
            "Ivory Coast was largely unaffected in 1976/77 as widespread tree plantings offset El Nino damage, leaving a stable crop trend.\n",
            "A second wave of prolonged El Nino damage arose between 1982 and 1984, when bush fires caused by abnormally dry weather swept through Ivorian plantations.\n",
            "\"In 1992/93 yields were good so prices were not seriously affected,\" said one analyst. Collapsing Eastern European consumption after the fall of the Berlin Wall coupled with plentiful world stocks had dampened supply fears, he added.\n",
            "\"Now there is a deficit forecast and consumption is again expanding in Asia,\" he said.\n",
            "UK-based trader ED &amp; F Man in its May report said, \"Unless the weather in West Africa improves, the cocoa market faces a substantial drawdown in stocks in 1997/98\".\n",
            "Man forecasts a supply deficit of 125-150,000 tonnes by the end of the 1996/97 season and a 34 percent rise in world grindings to 2,795,000 tonnes.\n",
            "Other analysts say it is too early to guess the effects of the El Nino.\n",
            "\"If the El Nino develops and hits in late 1997 there will be no effect on the cocoa. The main crop (Oct-April) will already be on the trees,\" one said. \"(It) would only affect next year's mid-crop (May-Sept).\"\n",
            "One crop analyst said scant rains in the 1993/94 crop year (Oct-Sept) resulted from El Nino weather but failed to damage crops because thick cloud cover over West Africa prevented a drop in soil moisture.\n",
            "Heavy rains have fallen throughout Ivory Coast over the past three weeks.\n",
            "\"People have not got terribly excited about it in the past,\" he added, referring to the effects of the previous El Nino reported in 1994. \"Futures may now be rising as people take on insurance cover but that stock can easily be dumped back into the market later if necessary.\"\n",

            "Apple Computer Inc. Friday said it plans to cut 4,100 jobs in a restructuring aimed at returning the company to profitability.\n",
            "The troubled computer maker said the restructuring, its second major overhaul in the last 12 months, will result in a $155 million charge in its second quarter ending in March.\n",
            "The reserve would be in addition to a planned $325 million charge the current quarter for the previously announced purchase of Next Software Inc.\n",
            "The cuts -- including 2,700 full-time employees and 1,400 contract workers -- were slightly less than what some analysts had expected. Apple said it planned to begin notifying employees about the layoffs later this month.\n",
            "Apple, once the darling of the computer industry, has suffered in recent years from missed opportunities, management turmoil and failed strategies that resulted in the firings of former Chief Executives John Sculley in 1993 and Michael Spindler in 1996.\n",
            "Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio, who took over about a year ago, said the latest restructuring was aimed at boosting Apple's core business.\n",
            "\"The top priorities guiding our reorganization are the rapid delivery of distinctive products for our loyal business, education, and home customers, and the development of a robust next-generation operating system to carry them into the future,\" Amelio said in a statement.\n",
            "\"We can best achieve these goals by streamlining our organization, simplifying our product lines to deliver fewer but much stronger models, and stopping investments in activities that are not central to these core businesses,\" he said.\n",
            "Over the last five quarters, Apple has posted more than $900 million in losses, reflecting slower sales of its flagship line of Macintosh personal computers and restructuring expenses.\n",
            "In a statement issued after the market closed, Apple said it will phase out its slow-selling Performa Macintosh home computers this spring in favor of Power Mac models.\n",
            "Disappointing Christmas sales of the Performa line led to a stunning $120 million loss in the first quarter of fiscal 1997 and a steep decline in Apple's market share.\n",
            "According to research firm Dataquest, Apple's share of the worldwide PC market tumbled to 5.2 percent last year from 7.9 percent in 1995.\n",
            "As part of the restructuring, Apple said it was exploring options for its Netwon hand-held personal assistant and will no longer produce Apple-branded Pippin devices, which enable television sets to access the Internet.\n",
            "While Apple will continue to enhance its Mac Operating System, the company said some parts of the system -- such as the Open Doc component software technology, Cyberdog, Open Transport, Game Sprockets, and Mac OS Development Tools -- will receive less money for upgrades.\n",

            "A bill to protect homeowners from paying unneccessary mortgage insurance was passed overwhelmingly by the House of Representative Wednesday.\n",
            "By a vote of 421 to seven, the House adopted the Homeowners Insurance Protection Act that would cancel mortgage insurance once the homeowner has built up sufficient equity.\n",
            "\"The truth is that a vast number of people are paying for insurance they no longer need,\" Representative Henry Gonzalez said during the debate on the bill. The Texas Democrat urged the Senate to quickly pass the measure.\n",
            "Consumer advocates say these policies cost homeowners millions of dollars a year.\n",
            "\"I think it would be hard for the Senate to resist moving forward,\" Michelle Meier, counsel for government affairs at Consumers Union, said. The House vote \"brings us really close to getting a final measure.\"\n",
            "But the mortgage insurance industry warned that the automatic cancellation proposal would raise the cost for loans with low downpayments.\n",
            "\"Unfortunately, the bill has serious flaws that would impose unnecessary government mandates and controls on the industry,\" said Suzanne Hutchinson of the Mortgage Insurance Companies of America.\n",
            "Currently, mortgage lenders require a borrower to obtain and pay for such insurance when the borrower is making a relatively small down payment, such as 5 percent of the purchase price of a home.\n",
            "Borrowers putting down 20 percent or more of the purchase price generally are not required to obtain insurance, which can cost $300 to $900 a year.\n",
            "The bill would automatically cancel a mortgage insurance policy if the homeowner was current on mortgage payments and had built up 25 percent equity of the original house value.\n",
            "The bill would not not apply to existing mortgages. The new rules would cover only mortgages and refinancings closed a year after enactment.\n",

            "Congress is counting on the proceeds to trim the deficit.\n",
            "But many of the companies that won licenses to offer a new generation of cellular phone service are now in financial hot water, raising doubts over whether the government will collect all the money owed.\n",
            "Any steps the Federal Communications Commission takes will send a message to future bidders and affect future airwave sales. The FCC \"is going to be setting a new precedent,\" a government official said.\n",
            "Government and industry officials said the FCC is considering restructuring the payments that last year's auction winners must make to the government. The agency is expected soon to put out different proposals for public comment.\n",
            "The bids have become loans from the government, with the winners paying interest on the money that's due for licenses to offer \"personal communications services,\" or PCS.\n",
            "The companies paid what were considered high prices. Many have since found it tough to raise financing.\n",
            "The options under study at the FCC include:\n",
            "-- Handling each company in a case-by-case manner. That way, payments could be restructured on an individual basis.\n",
            "-- Deferring payments for a number of years -- say five, for example -- after which companies would make their interest payments and then pay off the remaining principal amount due. The breathing space would give companies time to build their PCS networks and make some money.\n",
            "-- Letting winners pay, up front, a discounted lump sum based on interest payments otherwise due in the future.\n",
            "The FCC also has been negotiating with the Treasury Department for help and advice. The FCC is \"not particularly expert in this area and never expected to be in it,\" the government official said.\n",
            "In addition, several winners -- including top bidder NextWave Telecom Inc. -- have asked the FCC for permission to make interest payments yearly, instead of quarterly.\n",
            "Last month, the FCC suspended the quarterly payments while it mulled the request -- a move that, according to one estimate, is costing the government $1.5 million daily.\n",
            "Government and industry officials said the FCC is in a tough spot, especially because Congress is depending on the auction revenues to help balance the government's books.\n",
            "If companies were to default on their payments and the FCC were to reauction the licenses, the new prices probably would be far less than the original amounts bid, analysts agreed.\n",
            "Many of the auction winners \"will soon face financial crises if the FCC does not act swiftly and decisively to change the license payment terms,\" MCI Communications Corp. told the FCC earlier this month.\n",
            "The No. 2 long-distance company -- which has signed a deal with NextWave to lease the company's PCS network to provide wireless services to it own customers -- wants the FCC to handle the companies' problems on a case-by-case basis.\n",
            "But others urge the FCC to reject that approach. They want the agency to develop a general rule -- through its usual rulemaking process -- that would apply to all companies.\n",
            "\"We are concerned that whatever the FCC does, it does it fairly and equally across the board,\" attorney Mark Tauber of Piper &amp; Marbury said. \"It's bad 'PR' for the commission if they give the idea that special deals are available.\"\n",
            "AirGate Wireless, which won four PCS licenses at an auction that ended early this year, wants the FCC to take more aggressive action: reinstate the quarterly interest payments; declare companies in default companies that fail to make payments; and reauction the licenses of those in default.\n",
            "\"Anything less sends a message to existing licensees and future auction bidders that the FCC will provide a financial safety net for bidders that bid beyond their financial capabilities,\" the Washington-based firm told the FCC.\n",
            "Meanwhile, the companies are expected to get some help from a recent global trade agreement that will make it easier for foreign communications companies to invest in U.S. carriers. The FCC is developing a proposal to implement the agreement, which could pave the way for foreign sources of money.\n",

            "The French government plans to privatise Thomson SA through the early sale of the latter's 58-percent stake in profitable defence electronics group Thomson-CSF and a later sale of Thomson SA's wholly-owned but loss-making Thomson Multimedia (TMM).\n",
            "The government earlier this month suspended the planned sale of Thomson SA to Lagardere Groupe after the independent Privatisation Commission objected to the terms of the planned resale of TMM to Daewoo Electronics.\n",
            "Le Monde said that during the December 16 supervisory board meeting of Thomson SA and Thomson-CSF, the management let it be known that it prefered a market sale over a private placement.\n",
            "\"Although the management representatives have not openly said that they prefer a market sale, they have said that such a float would allow a quicker sale and also added that it was necessary to go quickly,\" an unnamed supervisory board member was quoted as saying in Le Monde.\n",
            "\"We have no comment. What is being said during a board meeting is part of the private life of the company,\" a Thomson spokesman told Reuters.\n",
            "\"(Chairman) Marcel Roulet's official position is that it is up to the seller, the Finance Ministry, to decide how to go about the sale,\" he added.\n",
            "The Lettre d'Expansion, a confidential newsletter, said on Monday that Roulet had sent a four-page letter to the government and the chairman of the Conseil d'Etat, the constitutional council, to argue for a market sale, an Offre Publique de Vente (OPV) in French.\n",
            "The Thomson-CSF sale is scheduled to take place in early 1997 while the Thomson Multimedia sale could take until 1998.\n",
            "Originally, the French state wanted to sell Thomson SA as a block and after an initial round of offers only two companies remained as likely buyer, Lagardere and Alcatel Alsthom.\n",
            "In October, the government said it prefered the Lagardere offer because of its plans to merger its Matra Defense Espace arm with Thomson-CSF to create a French defence giant.\n",
            "Industry sources said that a market float of Thomson-CSF, already a world player in defence electronics and radars, would allow the company's management to negotiate on its own terms any alliances in a French or European defence restructuring.\n",
            "If it were sold in a private placement, either to Lagardere, Alcatel or any other suitors, the new owner would decide policy.\n",

            "At least 10 people were killed and many wounded when about 1,000 Moslem separatists of the Uighur ethnic minority rampaged through Yining last Wednesday, smashing cars, burning shops and beating up Han Chinese to protest against Beijing rule.\n",
            "\"Both Han Chinese and Uighurs were killed or injured,\" a propaganda official said by telephone from Yining in the Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture near the border with Kazakhstan.\n",
            "A Chinese source with close links to the government said the riot was among the most violent for many years in Xinjiang, where Turkic-speaking Uighurs are in the majority and ethnic Han Chinese make up just 38 percent of the population.\n",

            "Officials described the riot as a small incident fuelled by \"foreign hostile forces\" and refused to say how many people were killed or wounded. Yining is 50 km (30 miles) from the border with Kazakhstan, where many exiled Uighur separatists live.\n",
            "However, the Chinese source said at least 10 people had been killed, including one police officer, and many wounded and arrested.\n",
            "\"One police officer was stabbed to death,\" said the source, who declined to be further identified.\n",
            "The riot erupted after a Chinese policeman tried to arrest a Uighur, he said. \"The police tried to arrest a Uighur criminal suspect but the suspect and his family resisted arrest.\"\n",
            "\"The scene attracted neighbours and onlookers and the crowd swelled to more than 1,000 and turned into rioting,\" he said.\n",
            "\"The police were called in and fired teargas to dispel the crowd.\"\n",
            "Rioters attacked ethnic Han Chinese on sight, smashed cars and set fire to shops, forcing local authorities to send out about 1,000 police and paramilitary People's Armed Police to quell the violence, the Han businessman said.\n",
            "\"Many people died,\" he said. \"Probably some 100 people were wounded.\"\n",
            "Hong Kong's Ming Pao newspaper said rioters set fire to the bodies of those killed.\n",
            "The demonstrators, shouting anti-Chinese slogans, had marched on a government building and police had asked them to disperse, said the propaganda official in Yining, about 700 km (440 miles) northwest of the Xinjiang capital, Urumqi.\n",
            "\"There was a demonstration and they shouted slogans calling for Han Chinese to be driven out of Xinjiang and for Xinjiang to be split from the motherland,\" he said, adding that the rioters had \"used the pretext of religion\".\n",
            "Xinjiang, considered by many Chinese as a wild frontier territory, has a long history of ethnic clashes between the native population of mainly Moslem ethnic minorities and the ruling Han Chinese.\n",
            "Xinjiang authorities last year stepped up a crackdown on separatists and underground religious activity after a series of violent clashes, bombings and assassination attempts on officials and Moslem leaders regarded as pro-Beijing.\n",

            "Last week, Mercury had its debt ratings lowered to default status by some major rating services after defaulting on the commercial debt.\n",

            "\"They're not ones that fit our business model, but they're ones that we think are good and ought to come to market,\" he said. \"We have one or two dozen technologies that Apple has decided to discontinue and (it is seeking to farm them out) rather than seeing them wither.\"\n",
            "Tesler declined to give details on what these further technologies were, other than the outline given last month in the company's restructuring announcement, and he said the method of seeking new sponsors to further develop and market the technologies would differ according to each.\n",
            "Tesler was attending the Sixth International World Wide Web Conference in Santa Clara, where he gave a presentation to a crowded audience on some of the hottest new Internet technology for use on Apple systems.\n",

            "Tsang Yok-Sing, the leader of Hong Kong's biggest pro-China party, had his baptism of fire in the violent riots that shook the territory during China's Cultural Revolution of the 1960s.\n",
            "Tsang was out on the streets during Hong Kong's 1967 riots, waving Chairman Mao Zedong's \"Little Red Book\", distributing leaflets and marching in the frontline of anti-British demonstrations.\n",
            "Tsang, a bright light in the new political regime that will replace British colonial rule in Hong Kong on July 1, was shaped by the indignity he felt about the Chinese not being masters of their own home in the territory for more than 150 years.\n",
            "The 49-year-old school headmaster makes no bones about the real quarrel between Britain and China over Hong Kong's return to Beijing's control. It's not the widely publicised polemics or legal wrangles about human rights and democracy, he says.\n",
            "For Tsang, it's \"the end of British rule -- the end of the institutions elected under the British constitution\".\n",
            "CULTURE CLASH\n",
            "It's a culture clash, the clashing of national prides.\n",
            "The Chinese are fired by the desire to shake off the last vestiges of an imperialist, colonial yoke, while the British rue their loss of an empire on which, once, the sun never set.\n",
            "\"The Chinese government has never really believed the British were happy to return Hong Kong to China,\" Tsang told Reuters in an interview.\n",
            "\"Most people in Hong Kong believe Hong Kong is part of China, that the territory should return to China, that British colonial rule should come to an end.\"\n",
            "And end it will, at midnight June 30, when the Union Jack is furled and China's red flag is raised over a capitalist Special Administrative Region (SAR), to which China has promised a high degree of autonomy under a \"one country two systems\" principle.\n",
            "Tsang Yok-sing is a man of humble working-class origins and a solid leftwing family. His parents moved to Hong Kong in 1949 as the Communists swept to power in a civil war in China. His brother, Tsang Tak-Sing, is the editor of China's propaganda mouthpiece in Hong Kong, the daily Ta Kung Pao newspaper.\n",
            "Tsang is the principal of the Pui Kiu leftwing junior school in Hong Kong's North Point, once a bastion of leftwing ferment.\n",
            "He is chairman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB), which lost heavily to the immensely popular pro-democracy Democratic Party in legislative elections in 1995.\n",
            "The DAB holds six seats in the elected 60-member Legislature but has scored nine seats in a provisional legislature which China plans to install on July 1 in place of the current chamber. The new body is packed with pro-China party members.\n",
            "BROTHER, SISTER JAILED DURING RIOTS\n",
            "Tsang recently wrote a graphic account of his early life including his involvement in the political mayhem that rocked Hong Kong during China's Cultural Revolution.\n",
            "\"When the 1967 riots broke out I was already a committed Marxist and I was in total sympathy with the workers who were only protecting themselves against the oppressive colonial government of the time,\" Tsang wrote.\n",
            "\"I was deeply affected by the dramatic events of '67. My brother, aged 18, was arrested during the riot and locked up in Stanley Prison for two years, and my sister was imprisoned for a month, aged only 15. Don't talk to me about human rights.\"\n",
            "\"My experiences drove me more to the other side. I worshipped Mao Zedong and he became my idol.\"\n",
            "Tsang made secret visits to China via Macau during those years and developed contacts on the mainland. He then abandoned a plan to study in the United States and went to work instead in the leftwing school where he is now principal.\n",
            "MAO'S DEATH DIMS YOUTHFUL REVOLUTIONARY SPARK\n",
            "But the spark of revolutionary youth dimmed when Mao died and his associates were arrested in 1976.\n",
            "\"I and my colleagues at the school felt very cheated after the fall of the Gang of Four...The Mao craze died down.\"\n",
            "But patriotic leftwing feeling was rekindled as China opened up in recent years, and as interest grew in the approaching return of Hong Kong to the motherland.\n",
            "The 1989 Tiananmen square pro-democracy protests in China drew one million sympathisers on to the streets in Hong Kong.\n",

            "Federal regulators and television broadcasters Thursday moved closer to agreeing on a stepped-up timetable for TV stations to begin providing high-definition digital broadcasts within 18 to 24 months.\n",
            "The issue has been a stumbling block in the Federal Communications Commission's plans to dole out to stations free digital TV licenses in the next two weeks. The new service promises crystal-clear pictures and CD-quality sound.\n",
            "Under pressure to jump-start the digital age, the National Association of Broadcasters and another industry group, the Association for Maximum Service Television, proposed that 31 stations in the 10 largest metropolitan areas begin broadcasting digital signals in 18 to 24 months.\n",
            "In some markets, up to four stations would be on the air in the shortened time frame. The top 10 markets include New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and other cities.\n",
            "Broadcasters previously had suggested more time was needed, with many stations saying it would take six years to install the needed equipment and put the digital signals on the air.\n",
            "\"I welcome the increased level of commitment for launching digital television,\" said Commissioner Susan Ness, who is trying to broker a pact between the FCC and the broadcasters. She said the broadcasters' plans \"move the ball forward in a very substantial manner.\"\n",
            "FCC officials stressed, however, that key details must be worked out -- in particular, how many digital broadcasts would begin over 18 to 21 months, something that is important to TV makers trying to offer digital sets in the key Christmas buying season. Twenty-four months would fall after Christmas 1998.\n",
            "TV set makers have said they would postpone offering digital sets an extra year if stations delayed significant introduction of digital broadcasts until 1999.\n",
            "Ness, as a result, said she has asked broadcasters to better detail TV stations' plans to be offering digital transmission by Christmas of next year.\n",
            "The roll-out schedule has been a key hurdle. FCC Chairman Reed Hundt had proposed that big network-owned stations in the top 10 markets start providing digital signals within the next year. That would translate into 26 large stations.\n",
            "Broadcasters said that was too quick. Hundt's office gave the broadcasters' latest plan a cautiously upbeat response.\n",
            "\"We're evaluting it. But obviously this is a very healthy dialogue between us and the industry,\" said Hundt's chief of staff, Blair Levin.\n",
            "Earlier this week Hundt sharply criticised broadcasters, questioning their commitment to digital TV.\n",
            "\"I'm beginning to wonder if broadcasters really want these licenses,\" Hundt told a meeting of the National Cable Television Association in New Orleans. \"A cynic would think that broadcasters just don't want someone else to have them.\"\n",
            "An official in Commissioner James Quello's office endorsed the new proposal as an \"agressive roll-out.\" Officials with Commissioner Rachelle Chong's office could not be reached for comment.\n",
            "Meanwhile, the FCC still must determine the level of public-interest obligations to impose on TV stations in exchange for the digital licenses, as well as other issues.\n",

            "\"We don't claim to have evidence of collusion. What we are doing is seeking an explanation from the banks,\" Fels said in a radio interview broadcast on Monday.\n",
            "National Australia Bank, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac Banking Corp all cut their standard variable mortgage rates by 0.35 percent to 7.2 percent on Friday, hours after the Reserve Bank cut official rates by 0.5 percent to 5.5 percent.\n",
            "Government and opposition politicians and consumer groups have since suggested the banks colluded to ensure they did not pass all of the official rate cut on to their customers.\n",
            "Fels said the commission would ask for details of any communications between the banks on Friday and whether there had been any previous discussion about their approach to possible official rate cuts.\n",
            "\"The reason why we're seeking an explanation from the banks is that it is unusual for them all to have moved so quickly within a few hours of one and other and to have reduced their rates by the same limited amount of 0.35 (points) as against a Reserve Bank reduction of 0.5,\" Fels said.\n",
            "\"Occasionally, one player will do something a bit different,\" Fels said.\n",

            "Dusek was quoted by the private television channel Prima after the decision to extend the strike that the OSZ would keep extending the strike until it gets an acceptable compromise.\n",
            "The OSZ had originally scheduled the action as a 48-hour strike, but said it would consider extending it for 24 hours at a time if its demands were not met.\n",
            "The government on Wednesday backed Transport Minister Martin Riman's hard line against the OSZ, which has shut the country's entire rail network over potential job cuts.\n",
            "Government spokesman Ivo Strejcek told reporters after a cabinet meeting that \"the government expressed its support\" for Riman, who has refused union demands for a long-term railway plan that guarantees jobs while sacking the current management.\n",
            "The spokesman declined any further comment.\n",
            "CTK quoted Riman later on Wednesday as saying a Prague court had ruled that the strike was illegal, but the OSZ then said that a different court had ruled that the strike was lawful.\n",
            "The strike, the first major nationwide post-Communist industrial action, has had little major impact on daily life, but businesses fear the shutdown in freight service will start to bite into earnings if the strike lasts longer.\n",
            "Cities have added buses to relieve commmuter pressure, but international trains have been stranded at borders with Germany, Poland, Austria, and Slovakia.\n",
            "Two rounds of talks between Riman and union officials on Tuesday failed to break the impasse, and the minister acknowledged the strike may go on longer. Fresh talks on Wednesday have apparently not yet led to a solution.\n",
            "The OSZ wants the government to implement a long-term plan to revive the decrepit railway system, saying that waste and inefficiency should be cleaned up before jobs are threatened.\n",
            "The state railway company, Ceske Drahy, lost six billion crowns ($216.4 million) in 1996, and expects to lose seven billion crowns this year, but the government has been unable to put together a viable plan for reversing the losses.\n",
            "Leaders of the OSZ reported that 75 to 80 percent of the more than 100,000 railway workers had joined the strike, but management of the railway company said over 60 percent showed up for work and signed a petition against the strike.\n",
            "An attempt to use workers who ignored the strike resulted in the operation of a just five trains on Wednesday, but the system was mostly idle.\n",
            "An effort to reconstruct Ceske Drahy ended in 1994 when the conservative government backed off privatisation plans to halt a threatened strike just hours before it was to begin.\n",
            "This time, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has given ominous warnings that the unions \"may go too far\" with the strike.\n",
            "Most major Czech firms have said a short-term strike will have little effect on their operations, though the coal mining company Mostecka Uhelna Spolecnost a.s. said it was losing between 15-20 million crowns a day due to the action.\n",

            "The opening of Australia's two largest casinos later this year is likely to put more pressure on the nation's already struggling small casinos, analysts said.\n",
            "Crown Ltd is set to open the A$1.6 billion Crown casino in Melboure in May, making it Australia's largest, while Sydney Harbour Casino Holdings Ltd (SHC) is expected to open the A$1.0 billion Sydney casino later this year.\n",

            "But the earnings outlook for Australia's smaller casinos is not so rosy. Breakwater Island Trust, which operates the Townsville casino in north Queensland, reported a 65 percent fall in net profit for the six months ended December 31, 1996.\n",

            "Since the opening of Sydney's temporary casino in late 1995, the operating performance of the Canberra casino, which is also operated by CAIL, has been badly hit, analysts said.  \n",
            "\"These (small) casinos, if they are relying on their local market, it would just be a flat business and if they want to get the junket market they will be fighting bigger Australian casinos,\" said Richard Wolf, an analyst at Bell Securities.\n",
            "Last month Australia's richest man and most renowned gambler Kerry Packer bought management control at the Sydney casino and Crown is looking to buy the management contract at the Melbourne casino from Hudson Conway Ltd.\n",
            "\"The industry is undergoing some rationalisation -- a lot of the changes seem to evolve around management issues,\" said Jenny Owen, tourism and leisure analyst at Macquarie Equities.  \n",
            "\"It all about the size of the market. I don't know if Australia is large enough to support 14 casinos, when you only have 18 million people,\" Owen told Reuters.\n",
            "However, analysts said it would too hard to predict if Packer's move into the Sydney casino would spark rationalisation amongst local casinos. Packer also has a stake in Crown casino, which has triggered rumours of a merger between the two.\n",
            "Packer's purchase was not the only change in casino ownership recently. The downmarket Alice Springs casino in the Northern Territory was recently sold to Malaysian investors and the Adelaide casino is expected to be put up for sale.  \n",
            "Analysts said it was still early days to say what impact the new Sydney and Melbourne casinos would have on the industry.\n",
            "\"When the Crown and Sydney permanment casinos open they will be a world first - there are no casino monopolies like this in any major city in the world. The only ones built to this size are in Las Vegas and Atlantic City,\" one casino analyst said.\n",
            "\"So nobody knows what is going to happen when these casinos open up their doors, there is no benchmark,\" the analyst said.\n",

            "The bid battle for British regional electricity company (Rec) Northern Electric was on a knife edge on Friday as predator CE Electric won an extension to 2400 GMT for an announcement of the result.\n",
            "CE, which is 70 percent owned by CalEnergy of the U.S., had slapped a deadline of 1300 GMT on Friday for acceptances of its 650 pence-a-share bid which values Northern at 782 million pounds ($1.3 billion) and the result was expected by 1700 GMT.\n",
            "But the authorities later agreed to allow the extension under British bidding rules as counting and matching of share acceptance forms continued.\n",
            "CE Electric already held nearly 30 percent of Northern, bought on the open market, and had previously declared acceptances which brought its holding up to around 34 percent.\n",
            "Northern has claimed it has the backing of its largest institutional investor, the Prudential, which holds around 11 percent, as well as other funds including M&amp;G and Foreign &amp; Colonial.\n",
            "The bid is the second hostile takeover that Northern has faced -- it spent 560 million pounds fending off Trafalgar House, now owned by Norway's Kvaerner, last year.\n",
            "That left it with depleted resources to fight this time, but it has promised a 17 percent hike in its dividend and vowed its gearing will be down to 95 percent by March 1997 compared with previous forecasts of 175 percent.\n",
            "Northern has consistently claimed that the bid undervalued it and called for a higher price.\n",
            "It said 700 pence per share was indicated in talks before CE Electric launched the offer on October 28, a claim which the Americans have denied, saying that the bid is fair value.\n",
            "Northern's share price closed in London up 2-1/2 pence at 640 pence in a generally firm market on Friday.\n",
            "Northern is the only Rec to have fought off a takeover after it spent 560 million pounds to fend off Trafalgar House, now owned by Norway's Kvaerner, last year.\n",
            "If it falls to CE, it would be the tenth of the 12 cash-rich Recs set up at privatisation in 1990 to be taken over since they came up for grabs when the government's protective golden share expired in March 1995.\n",
            "It would also be the fourth to be taken over by an American company with two further agreed bids from U.S. firms Dominion Resources and Entergy for East Midlands and London respectively currently underway.\n",
            "American companies are hotly tipped as the most likely buyers for the remaining Recs as they find the British regulatory environment more relaxed and see them as a useful English-speaking springboard for expansion into Europe.\n",
            "Among potential bidders, analysts named Houston Industries, which failed in its attempt to secure control of Norweb with Central &amp; South West Corp in October 1995.\n",
            "Florida Power &amp; Light and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, which have both been rumoured previously to be interested in Recs, are again being eyed as possible buyers.\n",
            "The UK Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang has made it clear that he will consider bids on a case by case basis and only judge whether they should be referred to monopoly investigation on competition grounds.\n",
            "CE Electric's bid had been clouded by worries that Lang might block the move because of political concerns or to avoid reducing the number of benchmarks in the sector used by the industry regulator Offer.\n",
            "There had been worries that the ruling pro-privatisation Conservative party, which lags the opposition Labour party in the polls and must call a general election by May, might not want further takeovers in the unpopular sector.\n",
            "Electricity companies have increasingly attracted harsh criticism from lobby groups and the media over hefty executive pay packets, huge shareholder payouts and spiralling takeover prices.\n",
            "Lang's decision to clear CE Electric's bid on December 6 lifted a cloud from Northern's shares, which had been languishing around 600 pence.\n",
            "It also indicated that other bids might not face any regulatory hurdles.\n",

            "Shares in British drugs company Zeneca Group Plc had another busy day on Friday as the bid rumour mill again started churning, overshadowing a key patent victory in the United States.\n",
            "Zeneca shares climbed 35 pence to 18.55 pounds ($30.06) in late afternoon trading after a U.S. Appeals Court threw out a patent challenge to one of its top-selling drugs, breast cancer treatment Nolvadex.\n",
            "The ruling, which follows a U.S. district court decision in Zeneca's favour a year ago, means that Canadian generic drug maker Novopharm Ltd will not be able to market a generic version of Nolvadex before Zeneca's patent runs out in 2002.\n",
            "But analysts said the ruling was widely expected and pointed the finger instead at the Swiss magazine Cash for driving up Zeneca's shares.\n",
            "Cash said Swiss giant Roche Holdings AG was about to announce an agreed takeover of the British group.\n",
            "Stephen Putnam, analyst at Kleinwort Benson, said: \"I think this rise has more to do with rumours about a Roche bid. I can't believe anybody thought there would be a different outcome (to the Novopharm appeal).\"\n",
            "In an unsourced article, Cash said Roche was planing to offer between 21 and 22 pounds per share for Zeneca, which it would then break up, selling off the agricultural chemical and specialty seeds divisions as well as Roche's own fragrances and aromas division.\n",
            "Both companies, increasingly weary of the mounting bid speculation, again declined to comment. But London analysts laughed the suggestion out of court.\n",
            "\"Frankly, for 21 pounds they'd be lucky to get the agricultural chemicals division. I think the bidding would start at 30 pounds,\" said one analyst who asked not to be identified. \"Zeneca is not interested and doesn't need to embark on a merger,\" he added.\n",
            "Zeneca's patent victory against Novopharm has, however, strengthened its main attraction for any possible bidder -- its strong product portfolio.\n",
            "Nolvadex is the world's top-selling breast cancer treatment, with sales of 2.7 billion pounds since its launch. Last year Zeneca sold 332 million pounds worth of Nolvadex, making it one of its biggest money spinners.\n",
            "Zeneca began legal action against Novopharm in January 1995 after the Canadian company tried to get U.S. regulatory approval for a generic version of Nolvadex, also known as Tamoxifen Citrate.\n",
            "Two other patent challenges for Nolvadex in the U.S, against Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc and Pharmachemie BV, are outstanding. A third, against Lemmon Co, was dropped after Lemmon withdrew its marketing application.\n",
            "Kevin Scotcher, analyst at NatWest Markets, said Zeneca's patent position was now much more secure as a result of the Novopharm ruling. \"This case must strengthen their hand significantly in those other cases,\" he said.\n",
            "Novopharm has been very active in legal challenges recently, last week successfully winning the right to market a generic version of one of the world's biggest-selling drugs, Glaxo Wellcome Plc's Zantac, from July.\n",

            "Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said on Tuesday that the Czech National Bank may have gone too far in its attempts to slow inflation quickly and the result may have been a slowing in economic growth.\n",
            "Speaking at Prague's Zofin Forum of business leaders Klaus said there was no way to slow inflation quickly, and that central bank steps last year to rein in consumer prices were more than the government wanted.\n",
            "\"At this moment I see in the Czech economy the existence of an array of short-term irremovable inflation factors which we cannot simply get rid of, and I also do not see any easy way to a faster slowing of inflation,\" said Klaus, a monetarist professor of economics.\n",
            "Klaus took issue with restrictive monetary measures of the Czech National Bank last year which helped cut inflation to 7.3 percent year-on-year in February from levels above nine percent in the previous year.\n",
            "He said that the government differed with the central bank on whether monetary tightening measures to slow inflation would slow the economy.\n",
            "\"I believe that in our context and in our structural parameters disinflation bought at the high price of a marked loss in the pace of economic growth was more than we would have wished,\" he added.\n",
            "Still, Klaus told his audience that February's inflation rate was \"satisfactory\".\n",
            "He said that 1996 full-year gross domestic product growth ended one percent lower than the government originally expected. He did not give a specific result. The government's original forecast was growth of 4.8 percent.\n",
            "Full-year official GDP results are expected later this month.\n",
            "Klaus said factors in this slowing of growth were weak demand for exports because of weak growth and protected markets in western Europe. Another reason was the \"unfavourable structure of our domestic demand -- consumer as well as investment.\"\n",
            "Klaus however stressed the \"restrictive measures of the central bank\" and its role on demand as a factor and said the CNB \"used\" the chaos after inconclusive June elections to raise interest rates and tighten minimum reserve requirements.\n",
            "He said the main problem facing the country's economy was a widening trade deficit, but he ruled out a devaluation of the crown to help the situation.\n",

            "Russian Norilsk Nickel's poor 1996 financial results have tarnished plans to issue corporate paper for trading overseas, but the key metal producer has profitable, stable output and may be crying wolf, analysts said on Monday.\n",
            "\"We don't think the (financial) figures will affect output,\" said Dmitry Chernak, metals analyst at ING-Barings in Moscow.\n",
            "He said Norilsk -- one of the world's top producers of nickel and platinum group metals -- might be fudging the figures to attract government attention to its crippling social costs.\n",
            "Company officials and analysts said Norilsk's 1996 consolidated loss of 3.29 trillion roubles ($572 million), which RAO Norilsky Nikel reported last Friday, did not mean the Arctic industrial behemoth had no cash to finance output.\n",
            "\"There is and will be absolutely no effect on production or exports,\" said Alexei Parshikov, director of Interrosimpex, which handles some of the Norilsk group's exports.\n",
            "He said wage arrears to workers were down to less than two months and workers had no inclination to strike as they did earlier this spring before a deal with management was reached.\n",
            "But Norilsk spokesman Sergei Vetchinin said the company's financial picture was nonetheless unattractive.\n",
            "\"It's a paradox -- the production of metals is profitable, but then the profits get spent on social costs, which in theory the state, not we, should be supporting,\" he said, adding that Norilsk made money on output but subsidiary costs sucked up over 40 percent of annual revenues.\n",
            "The London Metal Exchange was closed on Monday for a bank holiday and most traders there were not available for comment.\n",
            "Norilsk is the world's second largest producer of nickel, a key component of stainless steel. It is the world's largest producer of palladium and one of the world's top three producers of platinum -- used in catalytic converters and jewellery.\n",
            "Chernak said Norilsk had better operating margins than its Western competitors but that rising output costs at the company would take their toll on 1996 margins.\n",
            "He said Norilsk's 1995 gross operating margin for nickel output was a robust 36 percent, and 34.8 percent for copper, compared with a Western metals industry average of 31.7 percent.\n",
            "Chernak said higher input costs would reduce Norilsk's margin to 23.0 percent for 1996, but he expected its 1996 net loss to ring in at $120 million equivalent -- far below the figures Norilsk announced.\n",
            "Norilsk's Vetchinin said the reported 1996 loss figure was calculated on an accruals basis, which meant it was not distorted by figures reflecting non-payment for goods or services, a problem plaguing Russian industrial companies and distorting balance sheets.\n",
            "But Chernak said Norilsk's loss was misleadingly bloated because it included, among other things, allocations to capital expenditure funds.\n",
            "A senior Norilsk official told Reuters the 1996 loss meant plans to issue American Depositary Receipts -- paper allowing shares in foreign companies to be traded on world exchanges and avoiding settlement hassles -- were on the backburner.\n",
            "\"That such a possibility (postponing the issue) is being examined is unquestionable,\" said Yuri Kaluzhsky, Norilsk's head for projects and corporate finance, who had told Reuters one month earlier that Norilsk planned to issue the paper by July.\n",
            "His statement sent Norilsk shares crashing by over 11 percent, and Norilsk ordinaries traded at $6.60 at 1320 GMT on the Russian Trading System. The paper rose 12 percent when the financially troubled company announced the issue.\n",
            "Norilsk is struggling to enact a restructuring plan in which it hopes the state will assume responsibility for financing its vast social infrastructure, including resettling tens of thousands of pensioners.\n",
            "Parshikov said efforts to push through restructuring would intensify. But Norilsk officials have been unable to say whether a recent board meeting had approved the plan. ($1 = 5,756 roubles)\n",

            "U.S. car giant Ford Motor Co announced 1,300 job cuts at its plant in northwest England on Thursday and unions immediately raised the spectre of strikes in the British automobile industry.\n",
            "Just months after giving the Halewood factory near Liverpool its global quality award for 1996, Ford told union leaders the new version of its mid-range Escort would not be built there.\n",
            "The new model is now likely to be built in Spain and Germany. Ford's proposed job cuts will reduce Halewood's workforce to just over 3,000, compared with a peak of 14,000 in the 1960s and around 4,500 now. Britain's Prime Minister John Major told parliament Ford's decision was \"very surprising\" and \"flies in the face of most investment decisions which are moving to the UK\".\n",
            "Ford has not said where the new model will be built. But unions believe the new model, due in 1999, will be built instead at Ford's plants in Valencia, Spain, and Saarlouis, Germany.\n",
            "The main unions, including the Transport and General Workers, announced they would be holding mass meetings at Ford plants around the country over the next week to see whether workers would take action in protest at the job cuts.\n",
            "The workers will be asked to support a motion backing \"all necessary measures, including a ballot for strike action, to secure the future of Halewood and for an equal investment across Europe for all locations\".\n",
            "British car factories were notoriously strike-prone in the 1960s and 1970s but have been barely touched by union action in recent years. Stoppages have fallen to record lows throughout industry in the 1990s.\n",
            "Ford sweetened the pill by saying Halewood could be the site to build a new vehicle, probably a multi-purpose people carrier.\n",
            "Angry workers blamed the decision to cut jobs in Halewood on what they see as a lack of legal protection for British workers.\n",
            "Britain has opted out of European Union's Social Chapter, which sets out minimum working conditions, and its generally looser labour laws make it \"cheaper to dump labour in the UK than on the continent\", one union boss said.\n",
            "\"In Germany, if Ford closes its plant there, it has to pay its people 18 months' pay in compensation. In the UK, we've got no Social Chapter, it's easier to shut us down,\" production line worker Phil Gornall said on his way into the Halewood plant.\n",
            "Industry analysts said Ford's need to cut costs and the failure of the Escort rather than problems at the plant were behind Ford's decision. The Escort's British market share fell to six percent in 1996 from 11 percent or more in the 1980s. Ford Europe lost $472 million in the third quarter of 1996, up from a loss of $320 million in the same 1995 period.\n",
            "Professor Garyl Rhys, a car industry expert at Cardiff university, said Halewood, now a model of industrial relations, was paying for the \"bad old days\" of the 1960s and 1970s, when the British car industry had a bad strike record.\n",
            "\"Because of the problems at Halewood and a number of other car plants in Britain, there was a reluctance to use them as sources for exports...You couldn't guarantee deliveries because of interruptions to production because of strikes,\" he said.\n",
            "Unemployment in the area around Halewood is already a major problem, with some local housing estates suffering from a jobless rate of nearly 40 percent.\n",
            "Local residents complained that shops, banks and supermarkets have closed as businesses moved out of the area, and they seemed resigned to further decline.\n",
            "\"I don't think the government is interested in Liverpool,\" said Mike Kelly, landlord of the Orient pub, used by many of the Ford workers. \"I don't know how long this pub will be here now -- this place is becoming like a ghost town.\"\n",

            "You couldn't tell it by their workplace -- a stuffy dark cave in the basement of an early 20th century block of flats -- hardly enough room for the two of them amid stacks of film cans and mounds of remnants that didn't make the cut.\n",
            "Still, life keeps getting brighter for the father and son team who have become the de facto storytellers of bittersweet Czech post-communist nostalgia.\n",
            "Director Jan Sverak is 31 and wears \"John Lennon\" glasses, while his grey-bearded father Zdenek is screenwriter and star. Can we call Dad the \"Czech Sean Connery\" as so many do?\n",

            "The story of an ageing bachelor's re-awakening when he takes an abandoned Russian boy under his wing on the eve of Prague's bloodless 1989 \"Velvet Revolution\" -- it is favoured to win an Academy Award this month, after picking up Hollywood's Golden Globe in January.\n",
            "Critics say the politically-charged comedy/drama, which draws heavily on the decades of animosity -- and jokes -- Czechs had for occupying Russian forces, may be one of the region's best offerings since the Czech new wave of the 1960s.\n",
            "FIRST OSCAR NOMINATION IN 1992\n",
            "The Sverak team made their first splash in 1992, when the post-war boys'-life drama-comedy \"Elementary School\" earned a first Oscar nomination but lost.\n",
            "\"When we had our first Oscar nomination we thought it would be the first and last time in our lives,\" says Jan.\n",
            "Jan says he met an American scriptwriter in Hollywood four years ago who had been nominated 15 times but had never won an Oscar.\n",
            "\"He is my example,\" Zdenek jumps in to say.\n",
            "While \"Kolya\" is set at the end of the communist era, it is again a mix of personal and political turmoil, seen often through a boy's eyes.\n",
            "The two Sveraks have a close father-son relationship, frequently boyishly embracing in a country where \"macho\" usually means never hugging or shedding a tear.\n",
            "\"We are more friends than a father and son. We are very close characters. He has the same sense of humour as me, and we cry in the same part of the films,\" Zdenek says,\n",
            "His son butts in to warn, \"They think we cry every time we watch the film.\"\n",
            "Awkward moments can sometimes occur when the son directs the father in love scenes.\n",
            "In one shot, Zdenek revels in a post-amorous glow with the actress Libuse Safrankova, a woman Jan remembers most for her popular roles as a princess in many Czech fairytales.\n",
            "\"The script says they just finished making love and I have to explain to them that they have to breathe a bit, that they just can't lay there like they are resting... and they have to touch each other... this is bizarre,\" Jan says.\n",
            "\"Yes, bizarre,\" echoes his father.\n",
            "After landing a deal with Miramax to distribute \"Kolya\" the Sveraks are working on an original English-language feature. The project is still a secret, while Zdenek finishes the script.\n",
            "After a film, television, and stage career which has made him one of the most popular personalities in the country since the early 1970s, Zdenek says he has no regrets that he did not defect to pursue his career like so many Czechs including Oscar-winning director Milos Forman.\n",
            "Jan, who came of age as a director after the revolution, says he will stay in Prague, despite offers to go abroad.\n",
            "\"This is the big advantage that we did not receive the Oscar for 'Elementary School' because I was so young and so hungry for American films... Now, I am not hungry any more, so we will make the European films,\" he says.\n",
            "\"There is no political reason to leave the country now and there are possibilities to make films in Europe, so why leave the country?\"\n",
            "But can the Sveraks' magic translate into English-language success? \"Kolya\" has been selling out art houses in New York and on the west coast, but does everyone get it?\n",
            "\"I think that you can get 100 percent of the meaning of 'Kolya', not 100 percent of the jokes,\" Jan says.\n",
            "\"I think the audience can catch the whole message, and not all the jokes unfortunately... But the political background and our geographic situation, that's part of this message...,\" Zdenek replies.\n",

            "Quaker said Snapple's U.S. and Canadian sales dropped 8 percent in 1996, with volume down 11 percent. Sales of its six-flavor Diet Snapple line, however, rose 23 percent in 1996.\n",
            "Chicago-based Quaker said it earned $18.1 million, or 12 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $47.8 million, or 36 cents a share, in the 1995 period. Excluding a $40.8 million pretax restructuring charge in the 1995 fourth quarter, Quaker posted a year-ago operating loss 18 cents a share.\n",
            "Fourth quarter revenues were $1.06 billion, down 10 percent from $1.18 billion a year earlier, which included $90.3 million from divested businesses.\n",
            "For the full year, Quaker said it earned $244 million, or $1.80 a share, which included a $113.4 million gain on divested business. In 1995, it earned $720 million, or $5.39 per share, with a $1.05 billion gain.\n",
            "Sales last year were $5.20 billion, 13 percent below the previous year's $5.95 billion, which included $796.9 million from divested businesses.\n",

            "A $100 million cutback in advertising and marketing costs in 1996 also helped results, analysts added.\n",
            "In a conference call, Smithburg said Quaker was committed to at least 10 percent real earnings growth in 1997. \"We're going to try like crazy to do even better than that,\" he said.\n",
            "Quaker management again pledged to turn around Snapple, which it bought over two years ago for $1.8 billion.\n",
            "\"We need to stabilize (Snapple's) volume\" in 1997, Smithburg said. \"Our goal is to operate Snapple at cash positive in 1997.\"\n",
            "Cash positive means Snapple is expected to be profitable, excluding goodwill charges of about $50 million a year.\n",
            "Quaker surprised some analysts by not taking a charge in the fourth quarter to reduce Snapple's value. Analysts had expected Quaker to take a large writedown for Snapple, potentially as high as $1 billion.\n",
            "Smithburg declined to comment on speculation and rumors that Quaker was looking to sell Snapple, a fruit-flavored and iced tea beverage business, and its Gatorade sports drink.\n",
            "He said Quaker's management continues to review steps to \"create value for shareholders,\" but declined to be specific.\n",

            "Gatorade is launching this year a \"Frost\" line of Gatorade beverages that will feature a \"cooling taste,\" Smithburg said. \"The trade acceptance has been nothing short of terrific.\"\n",

            "Ready-to-eat cereals, such as Cap'n Crunch and Life, gained 3 percent in volume for 1996. The value-priced line of bagged cereals grew more than 40 percent in the year.\n",

            "The nadir came in August 1996 when China accused Australia of moving too close to the United States, after U.S. Secretary of Defence William Perry described Japan and Australia as the northern and southern anchors of Washington's Asian security arrangements.\n",

            "At least 10 people were killed and many wounded when about 1,000 Moslem separatists of the Uighur ethnic minority rampaged through Yining last Wednesday, smashing cars, burning shops and beating up Han Chinese to protest against Beijing rule.\n",
            "\"Both Han Chinese and Uighurs were killed or injured,\" a propaganda official said by telephone from Yining in the Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture near the border with Kazakhstan.\n",
            "A Chinese source with close links to the government said the riot was among the most violent for many years in Xinjiang, where Turkic-speaking Uighurs are in the majority and ethnic Han Chinese make up just 38 percent of the population.\n",
            "\"A circular has been issued and broadcast on television ordering people not to go out after dark,\" said a Han resident.\n",

            "Officials described the riot as a small incident fuelled by \"foreign hostile forces\" and refused to say how many people were killed or wounded. Yining is 50 km (30 miles) from the border with Kazakhstan, where many exiled Uighur separatists live.\n",

            "\"The scene attracted neighbours and onlookers and the crowd swelled to more than 1,000 and turned into rioting,\" he said.\n",
            "\"The police were called in and fired teargas to dispel the crowd.\"\n",
            "Rioters attacked ethnic Han Chinese on sight, smashed cars and set fire to shops, forcing local authorities to send out about 1,000 police and paramilitary People's Armed Police to quell the violence, the Han businessman said.\n",
            "\"Many people died,\" he said. \"Probably some 100 people were wounded.\"\n",
            "Hong Kong's Ming Pao newspaper said rioters set fire to the bodies of those killed.\n",
            "The demonstrators, shouting anti-Chinese slogans, had marched on a government building and police had asked them to disperse, said the propaganda official in Yining, about 700 km (440 miles) northwest of the Xinjiang capital, Urumqi.\n",
            "\"There was a demonstration and they shouted slogans calling for Han Chinese to be driven out of Xinjiang and for Xinjiang to be split from the motherland,\" he said, adding that the rioters had \"used the pretext of religion\".\n",

            "The charge reflects the company's plans to close about 115 low-volume satellite units across the United States this year. As of Dec. 31, McDonald's had 2,218 satellite units, which typically have a limited menu and are located in non-traditional sites like shopping malls.\n",
            "\"These are really the sites that didn't pan out,\" said McDonald's Chief Financial Officer Mike Conley.\n",
            "In 1997, McDonald's said it plans to open fewer satellite restaurants, while emphasizing full-scale units. As a result, McDonald's is trimming its overall restaurant opening plan for 1997 to between 2,400 and 2,800, compared with a previous target of 2,500 to 3,200.\n",
            "\"Going foward we think our emphasis is going to be traditional restaurants,\" Conley said in an interview.\n",
            "McDonald's said more than 70 percent of the new restaurants will be outside the United States. In the past, about two-thirds of McDonald's new units have been outside the United States.\n",
            "The fast-food giant, with more than 21,000 units worldwide, including 12,000 in the United States, said it is working to improve its U.S. results.\n",
            "In the fourth quarter, McDonald's said its U.S. operating income fell 28 percent, including the charge, to $217.7 million. Excluding the charge, U.S. operating income fell 4 percent.\n",
            "As analysts had expected, McDonald's said its domestic same store sales -- measuring results from units open at least a year -- were down in the fourth quarter and for all of 1996 compared with a year earlier.\n",
            "Offsetting the decline domestically was a 14 percent gain in international operating income and an 11 percent rise in sales in the fourth quarter.\n",
            "In the United States, however, McDonald's performance fell short of its goals, according to Jack Greenburg, company vice chairman and chairman-U.S.A. \"In 1997, our focus will be squarely on improving sales at existing restaurants through improvements in marketing, service and menu,\" he said in a statement.\n",
            "Conley said McDonald's will continue to be aggressive on pricing in the face of competition, but declined to give any specifics.\n",
            "\"We want to provide the best value to our customers ... and a big part of it is price,\" he said. \"You'll see us being aggressive on price-value as we always have been.\"\n",
            "Schroder Wertheim analyst Wayne Daniels said he expects McDonald's to launch more national price promotions in 1997, as opposed to its current practice of giving franchisees the option to offer local promotions.\n",
            "\"(McDonald's) average ticket did climb during 1996,\" when it launched higher-priced premium sandwiches such as the Arch Deluxe, Daniels said. \"I do think that they will reverse that somewhat as they are a little more aggressive on national price promotions.\"\n",
            "Conley said McDonald's will continue to work on food taste, but said changes would be \"evolutionary and not revolutionary.\"\n",
            "\"So don't expect a spate of new products,\" he said. \"That's really unlikely.\"\n",
            "McDonald's stock gained $1.125 to $46.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.\n",

            "Anglo-Dutch consumer products group Unilever NV/Plc reported a 15 percent rise in annual profits on Tuesday and put its speciality chemicals units up for sale in a move tipped to raise up to 5 billion British pounds ($8.17 billion).\n",
            "Pre-tax profit rose to 2.66 billion pounds ($4.4 billion) on a 6 percent rise in revenues to 33.52 billion ($54.7 billion). 2.\n",
            "Unilever shares surged on the results, which were better than analysts had forecast, and on the planned speciality chemicals sale.\n",
            "Unilever Plc shares surged 86-1/2 pence to 1,479-1/2 ($24.17) in London as some looked to raise 1997 forecasts.\n",
            "Chairman Niall FitzGerald said the sale of the speciality chemicals businesses would enable the group to concentrate on achieving growth in its consumer goods operations, particularly in developing and emerging markets.\n",
            "Analysts said the sale, which could free Unilever up for a major acquisition in its main food, detergents and personal products businesses, was well timed.\n",
            "FitzGerald said, meanwhile, that the overall economic situation in 1997, as in 1996, was likely to be generally favourable for the group, which is the world's largest producer of both margarine and ice cream, with activities from food to toiletries.\n",
            "But he saw little reason to believe that conditions in Europe, particularly in France and Germany, would improve.\n",
            "\"We will now seek actively buyers for the totality or the individual (chemicals) businesses and we will then assess those over the next month or two,\" FitzGerald told Reuters. \"We would hope to conclude a sale in the course of the next three to six months.\"\n",
            "FitzGerald declined to say how much the businesses, with 15,800 staff in more than 35 countries, might be worth.\n",
            "Analysts estimate the sale should fetch 4.5 billion to 5 billion pounds ($7.35 billion to 8.17 billion), and FitzGerald told a news conference in the short term it would wipe out the company's net borrowings of 1.7 billion pounds ($2.78 billion).\n",
            "The funds would also be used for acquisitions in growth areas, FitzGerald told reporters, such as Asia Pacific and South America and in priority categories like detergents, tea, ice cream, yellow fats, personal care products and fragrances.\n",
            "\"We have a carefully defined list of what we may do with (the proceeds), which I am not prepared to discuss,\" he said. \"In China I would like to have a business 10 times the size.\"\n",
            "The four units -- National Starch and Chemical Company, Quest International, Unichema International and Crosfield -- have combined turnover of 3 billion pounds ($4.9 billion), 9 percent of Unilever's total sales, and showed operating profit of 415 million ($678 million) in 1996, with margins of 14.1 percent.\n",
            "\"These are extremely large and important parts of our businesses but for some time we have been reviewing whether they should be a continuing part of the portfolio -- not because they are poorly performing themselves, they are excellent performers -- but whether we can give them the concentration and the focus that they require,\" FitzGerald said.\n",
            "\"...if you look at the way this industry is developing we have to take a decision either to significantly improve our presence in these markets, perhaps double it, or to exit and in exiting to concentrate on the other 90 percent of our business which is our mainstream consumer goods business.\"\n",
            "Commenting on the overall results, Unilever said its performance in Europe was held back by poor weather hitting ice cream sales and by the impact of the mad cow disease crisis.\n",
            "But good progress in North American market conditions provided the basis for better results there and the momentum of growth continued strongly in the fast-growing emerging markets.\n",

            "No date has been set for the talks called by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. The talks would be the first formal negotiations since November 1995, when a tentative agreement, subsequently rejected, was submitted to UAW members.\n",
            "The 17-month strike ended in December 1995 without a new contract. Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar's workers have been without a contract since 1991.\n",

            "A union official said jobs and job security have been main issues throughout negotiations, while almost 400 unfair labour practice complaints by the UAW and seniority problems have also become issues.\n",
            "\"I've always felt that there's going to come a time when it would make a good business decision for the company\" to reach a labour agreement, Jim Clingan, executive vice president of UAW local 974 in Peoria, said. But he added that he did not know if that time has been reached.\n",

            "TVX Gold Inc is taking steps to join the ranks of major mining companies, bringing aboard three senior executives who pledge to turn the company into a million-ounce-a-year gold producer.\n",
            "\"We're here to help TVX grow,\" said Cliff Davis, the new senior vice-president of North American operations, among three officers who joined TVX in the past month.\n",
            "\"We understand the need for organization. We understand realistic plans. I think that's something we can help TVX with,\" Davis told Reuters in an interview.  \n",
            "Davis's next plan is to speed production at the New Britannia mine in Manitoba and develop more reserves at Casa Berardi in Quebec.\n",
            "Joining Davis at TVX are David Murray, the recently appointed president and chief operating officer, and Ken Sangster as senior vice-president of European operations.\n",
            "The three have worked together before. They did stints at mining giant RTZ-CRA Corp Plc and have years of experience with huge projects.  \n",
            "\"For us it was a perfect fit,\" said TVX spokesman Ed Baer. \"One of the things that was a common concern to the market was our lack of management.\"\n",
            "Toronto-based TVX split off from Inco Ltd in 1993 and has concentrated on expanding its assets.\n",
            "With its interests now growing in Canada, Greece, Brazil, Ecuador, Chile, the Czech Republic and Russia, the company is ready to switch its focus to production, he said.\n",
            "TVX has promised its shareholders it will be producing 1.1 million ounces of gold a year by the year 2000 from 423,000 ounces in 1995.  \n",
            "To help keep its promise, the company has placed its bets on the Kassandra Mines in Greece. \"If everything works for us, the story really lies in Greece,\" said Baer.\n",
            "The property so far is expected to produce 300,000 ounces of gold a year at a cash cost of US$150 an ounce. TVX was still drilling and would not have a clear idea until next spring what the deposit offered, said Baer.\n",
            "Uncertainty over Kassandra has unsettled TVX stock. Its shares peaked at 14.85 in Toronto during a road show and high gold bullion prices last winter. But the stock has since slid.  \n",
            "With its stock now trading around 10 on the Toronto Stock Exchange and around 7.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, TVX has been rumored as a takeover target for some major gold producers.\n",
            "But as a growing company, TVX is always looking for joint ventures and is on the prowl for small mining companies with proven reserves, Baer said.\n",
            "Davis's first move at TVX was to shut the company's gold mine in Montana earlier this month.\n",
            "The Mineral Hill mine drained money from the company for years. TVX hoped to revive it with additional ore found at nearby Crevice Mountain, but ore grades at Mineral Hill grew worse and the company could not keep its mill supplied.\n",
            "Although the company continues to explore at Crevice, Davis did not hold out much hope for a resurrection of mining on the property.\n",

            "A lone highway from Norilsk airport to the company town winds across blinding, snow-blanketed tundra, across which locals say lurk an array of nuclear missiles primed to strike.\n",
            "After an hour's bumpy ride, the Arctic sun struggles behind a pall of filth and Norilsk, one of the world's biggest metals combines and a monument to Soviet industrial might, rises menacingly from a gruesome, gritty blanket of smelter fumes.\n",
            "The dark air here is so polluted that for the average local resident, life ends at 50.\n",
            "Apartment hallways can be covered in blue ice when temperatures drop below minus 50 Celsius (-58 Fahrenheit) in winter.\n",
            "\"Norilsk was built for working, not living,\" said Andrei Samokhin, spokesman for Norilsk Nickel, the company that effectively is the town. \"There's nothing to do but work.\"\n",
            "DEADLY PAST, POISONED FUTURE, LITTLE GOLD FOR WORKERS\n",
            "Norilsk pulses with the ghosts of at least 100,000 political prisoners whom Soviet dictator Josef Stalin exiled to this forsaken spot in the 1930s and 40s to work one of the planet's richest, but most desolate, sites for turning mineral deposits of nickel, platinum, gold and other ores into pure metals.\n",
            "For Mitrofan Rubeko, a rare 85-year-old survivor of Stalin's purges, Norilsk, 200 miles (320 km) north of the Arctic Circle, is an outpost of outrage. \"None of the young want to remember the history of Norilsk,\" he said in his spartan apartment.\n",
            "Norilsk has no monument to the innocent victims of forced labour, no mention of them in the town museum and no talk of one of the most prominent episodes in the Soviet Union's climb to a communist industrial heaven. Not one book has been published in Russia on the town's real history. Company officials have ignored Rubeko's request to erect a monument.\n",
            "Norilsk does have a monument to the town's first \"engineers\". Most were officers in the secret police that later became the KGB. They supervised thinly clad prisoners labouring in the open air and sleeping in wooden barracks with ice floors.\n",
            "Norilsk now has three nickel and copper smelters, two of them skeletal dinosaurs belching poisonous gases. It has metals processing and enriching plants and some of the world's richest mines of nickel, platinum, palladium, cobalt, copper and gold.\n",
            "The new generations of Norilsk's 300,000 residents -- some descendents of Stalin's victims, others children of later, hardy souls who headed north decades ago for higher wages -- are miners and metalworkers who look a decade older than they are.\n",
            "\"It's so ecologically dangerous in Norilsk, you aren't even supposed to give birth here,\" said Sergei Yurshov, director of the main nickel plant's electrolysing unit.\n",
            "Norilsk says it is in the throes of financial crisis -- but its streets are literally paved with gold.\n",
            "Tonnes of filthy cancer-inducing black slag, sparkling with precious metals, are collected from the smelters and sifted over streets to keep them from freezing.\n",
            "\"The state sees the bullion, but this is all we see,\" said Boris Degtyarov, an official at the main trade union.\n",
            "There is more beautiful poison at the electrolysing plant, where luminous, lime-green liquid nickel, laced with electricity, is processed from matt black slabs glinting with the earth's most prized metals.\n",
            "The dark cobbled floors and 1940s technology, exposing steel entrails and frames of processing lines, have a mediaeval air.\n",
            "Concentrations of carcinogenic nickel in the air are 200 times Western norms and 20,000 times the worthy but never attained Soviet standard.\n",
            "In Norilsk, women retire at 40, men at 45. Degtyarov says 90 percent of newborn babies have serious illnesses or handicaps. An aura of illness pervades everything here. One mine, Keyerkan, means Valley of Death in the language of the local Dolgan people.\n",
            "Despite the richness of its ore mines, Norilsk has not created wealth for its workers.\n",
            "Difficulties in keeping tabs on just who exports its multi-billion dollar output, and vast tax arrears have not helped the labour force, whose wages are two months behind.\n",
            "\"Where's the money for the metals going?\" asked Rubeko, shaking his silver-haired head. \"That I cannot understand.\"\n",
            "A FROZEN, UNDERGROUND HELL\n",
            "Deep in the Taimyr mine, 1.5 km (one mile) below the permafrost, is a darker world, where miners labour round the clock in shifts and cavernous tunnels worm through the earth.\n",
            "Get lost and you are in severe danger -- engineers daily blast out new galleries with dynamite. The rule for finding the way out -- hold up a wet finger and sense the faint breeze from the ventilation shaft.\n",
            "The lift, a 15 minute or so ride, rumbles like a distant rocket's afterburners.\n",
            "\"The lift cables are rusted,\" said duty operator, Sergei. \"But we love our jobs,\" he added, inciting laughter from miners waiting to be ferried down into the bowels of the Arctic.\n",
            "The Soviet authorities saw Norilsk as the embodiment of the socialist city-factory and as an organising principle for society. Now the remains of that vision are being tested by new market forces. Already hundreds of homeless live in the town's boiler plants.\n",
            "Company officials speak of uprooting pensioners to warmer climes, where they would cost less to support, and of the need to trim a bloated workforce.\n",
            "The plans have made Norilsk a barometer of the troubles faced by Russian industries in casting off their Soviet legacy. But they are hotly contested.\n",
            "\"You'd need two Kalashnikovs for every policeman if you had a load of unemployed wandering these streets,\" Degtyarov said.\n",
            "Rubeko, dragged to Norilsk in 1938 after a midnight knock at his door in southern Russia, despairs at the thought of a second exile. \"You can't resettle an 85-year-old man,\" he said.\n",
            "After working at Norilsk for 66 years, Rubeko, now head of the local chapter of the Society for the Defence of the Victims of Stalinist Repressions, cannot even afford new shoes.\n",
            "When asked what Norilsk was for him, he answered, \"a grave\".\n",

            "Senior North Korean official Hwang Jang-yop turned 74 on Monday with no sign of progress to celebrate in his appeal for political asylum in the South and he remained marooned in Seoul's heavily-guarded consulate office in Beijing.\n",
            "South Korea braced for possible attacks by Pyongyang as the Cold War crisis escalated, but said confrontation over the defector holed up in Seoul's embassy in Beijing would not scuttle its efforts for detente.\n",
            "Another prominent defector, Li Il-nam, a nephew of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il's ex-wife, remained in a coma after being critically wounded at the weekend by suspected North Korean agents near Seoul.\n",
            "Security around South Korea's ports, airports and other public places has been beefed up and 10,000 police and soldiers searched for the two suspected North Korean agents who shot Li.\n",
            "Seoul Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha said problems stemming from Hwang's defection were just the start of headaches for Seoul because of a crisis in the North.\n",
            "\"I believe the North Korean regime's crisis will deepen as time passes because there's no likelihood of improvement in its economic hardship and food shortages, and signs of laxity in its social order,\" Yoo told a meeting of South Korean diplomats.\n",
            "South Korea's security-related ministers on Sunday agreed that a desperate North Korea could resort to guerrilla attacks after Hwang, a top adviser to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, sought asylum last Wednesday.\n",
            "Dour warnings from North Korean officials in Beijing of the consequences of any attempt to move Hwang to the South gave a hint of Pyongyang's willingness to retaliate.\n",
            "\"If they make him go to Seoul, I think there will be war,\" said one North Korean official who declined to be identified.\n",
            "\"We want him back,\" he said, in an echo of earlier threats to use force if Hwang was compelled to go to Seoul.\n",
            "South Korean diplomats and Chinese police guarding the mission brought in extra blankets and mattresses in a sign they expected a lengthy stand-off over Hwang.\n",
            "However, dozens of North Korean officials disappeared on Monday afternoon from outside the building where they have kept a round-the-clock vigil since Hwang turned up in a taxi with an aide last Wednesday.\n",
            "North Korea's ambassador was believed to have met officials at China's Foreign Ministry on Monday, but it was not known if they discussed Hwang's defection.\n",
            "China, an unwilling third party in the feuding between the two hostile ends of the Korean peninsula, has appealed to both sides to act calmly to resolve the affair.\n",
            "Western diplomats said China had said privately it wanted little to do with the imported crisis in its backyard, saying Hwang was now effectively in South Korea. It is unwilling to favour an old communist comrade or a new capitalist friend.\n",
            "The United States has urged Pyongyang to avoid provocative actions and has said it is closely monitoring developments between the two Koreas, arch-enemies since the 1950-53 Korean civil war ended only in a truce.\n",
            "Analysts say the North has suffered huge loss of face over the defection of Hwang, who was ranked high in the hierarchy of his Stalinist homeland and was the architect of its governing ideology of Juche, or strict self-reliance.\n",

            "When thousands of auto dealers rolled into Las Vegas for their annual convention last year, there was much clamour over the looming onslaught of no-haggle superstores.\n",
            "As dealers prepare for this year's gathering, which starts Saturday in Atlanta, the juggernaught is upon them.\n",
            "Republic Industries Inc., the company controlled by billionaire investor Wayne Huizenga of Blockbuster Video fame, is on a buying spree that may have already made it the largest auto dealer group in the nation.\n",
            "Within two months, Republic, which includes the AutoNation USA superstore chain, has gone from owning no new-car franchises to six dealer groups.\n",
            "In the meantime, officials at CarMax, the auto superstore chain owned by Circuit City Stores Inc., said earlier this month they would consider buying existing dealerships and adding more new-car outlets as part of their expansion plans.\n",
            "\"I think it's got a lot of dealers rattled,\" said John Sinclair, owner of Sinclair Ford of Festus in Festus, Mo.\n",
            "The sweeping changes prompted industry trade magazine Automotive News to ask in its most recent edition: \"Apocalpyse Now?\"\n",
            "Before its latest purchase, Montgomery Securities estimated Republic's 1997 franchised dealership revenues at $2.5 billion. That puts it ahead of the previous largest group, Hendrick Automotive Group, which has estimated 1997 revenues of $2.4 billion.\n",
            "The explosive growth of Republic, CarMax and others comes as Detroit's Big Three automakers have backed off their traditional resistance to publicly owned dealerships.\n",
            "Ford Motor Co. Chairman Alex Trotman told dealers in Las Vegas a year ago that the No. 2 automaker had no plans to follow Chrysler Corp. and award a new car franchise to an auto superstore.\n",
            "But the automaker reversed its position in December when it formed an alliance with Republic that resulted in the sale of Ohio-based Mullinax Management, one of the country's biggest Ford dealers, to Republic.\n",
            "Ford Chief Financial Officer John Devine said earlier this week the automaker still believes the private enterprise system is the best for the industry.\n",
            "But he added, \"We also have to recognise that changes are here and more changes are going to come.\"\n",
            "How profitable and successful the superstores ultimately become remains to be seen. But in the short term, they are helping turn the tradition-bound retail car industry upside down. Armed with capital, the auto superstores have taken sophisticated mass-market retail concepts honed in such places as consumer electronics stores and applied them to the new and used vehicle market.\n",
            "The results are huge lots of high-quality, pre-certified used cars. Buyers who dread walking into an old-fashioned car dealerships enter the new superstores to find user-friendly computer kiosks and childrens' play areas. Salaried sales representatives offer low-pressure help, vehicles at no-haggle prices and 30-day bumper-to-bumper warranties.\n",
            "\"I think there's going to be a revolution in the car business,\" Fred Ricart, owner of Ricart Ford in Columbus, Ohio, said earlier this month during a panel discussion at the Automotive News World Congress.\n",
            "Ricart, whose own dealership is structured in an auto mall format, believes traditional dealers can overcome their negative sterotypes and compete. But he says they have to find new ways of improving and measuring customer loyalty and satisfaction.\n",
            "\"The advantage the superstores have is they've got a clean slate going in,\" he said.\n",
            "The National Automobile Dealers Association's 80th Annual Convention and Equipment Exposition will be held at the Georgia World Congress in Atlanta, from Feb. 1-4.\n",

            "The fallout from news that Bre-X Minerals Ltd.'s Busang gold discovery may be nowhere near as rich as it projected rocked the mining world and Canadian markets on Thursday, with securities regulators scrambling to investigate.\n",
            "Gold shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange, Canada's biggest equities market, tumbled more than 300 points or almost 3.0 percent in frenzied trading on Thursday, dragging down the entire market.\n",
            "Canadian regulators were working closely with Toronto exchange officials to unravel the biggest mining controversy in decades.\n",
            "\"We're working with the TSE on this matter. I don't know what will come of that. There really isn't more I can tell you,\" said a spokesman for the Ontario Securities Commission, the province's securities regulator.\n",
            "While other small mining stocks were hammered, Bre-X remained halted in Toronto and on Nasdaq as huge questions loomed over its claim to have made the biggest gold discovery this century.\n",
            "Bre-X, which soared to C$250 from mere pennies before a 10-for-1 stock split, last traded at C$15.50 before it was halted on Wednesday. The company was expected to issue a further news release on Thursday, the Toronto exchange said.\n",
            "Several Canadian mutual fund managers planned to write down their Bre-X holdings, while market players speculated the stock could re-open below C$2.\n",
            "\"We have Canadian funds marking it at C$1, C$2. Two dollars is C$500 million ($365 million) in market cap -- that's still a lot of money,\" a New York arbritager said.\n",
            "Calgary, Alberta-based Bre-X admitted on Wednesday that test samples from the Busang gold property on the island of Borneo may have been overstated.\n",
            "The news came just one week after the mysterious death of Bre-X's chief Busang geologist, who plunged out of a helicopter into the jungle in an apparent suicide.\n",
            "Bre-X Chief Executive David Walsh, who made millions from the discovery, is believed to have returned to the Bahamas where he now lives.\n",
            "Walsh earlier this week complained about rumors that the find may be overstated and even threatened legal action \"against certain parties and publications.\"\n",
            "But he admitted on Wednesday that \"there appears to be a strong possibility that the potential gold resources on the Busang project in East Kalimantan, Indonesia have been overstated because of invalid samples and assaying of those samples.\"\n",
            "New Orleans-based Freeport McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc., Bre-X's partner in Busang, set off the alarm bells on Wednesday, saying that its own studies so far \"indicate insignificant amounts of gold.\"\n",
            "Shares in Freeport were up 50 cents to $30.125 on Thursday after sinking sharply on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.\n",
            "Toronto, Canada's financial capital, has been a major source of capital for small mining companies venturing abroad. Analysts predicted the Bre-X story would hurt Toronto's image and make it much harder to raise cash.\n",
            "\"No matter who ends up wearing the blame for Bre-X's woes...and there looks to be plenty of blame to go around...the integrity of all junior mining stocks has taken a serious hit,\" Toronto Globe and Mail columnist Andrew Willis wrote.\n",
            "Bre-X earlier this year issued confirmed estimates that the Busang deposit held at least 71 million ounces of gold, worth about $20 billion at current gold prices.\n",
            "At that level, Busang would be the most significant gold find since the discovery of the Witwatersrand goldfields in South Africa in the late 1800s.\n",
            "Bre-X's head of exploration John Felderhof, who was recently honored at a mining conference in Toronto, asserted last month that Busang may contain up to 200 million ounces of gold.\n",
            "Bre-X shares sank last week after an Indonesian newspaper report quoted unnamed sources as saying Freeport, which holds 15 per cent of Busang, had doubts about the size and viability of the deposit.\n",
            "The rumors were fanned to fever pitch by the death, billed as a suicide, of Bre-X chief geologist Michael de Guzman, who fell from a helicopter en route to Busang last week.\n",
            "Bre-X and its maverick chairman Walsh have been the envy of the international mining community since Walsh gambled the company's last C$10,000 ($7,280) in 1993 and struck gold in Indonesia's East Kalimantan province.\n",
            "\"There's nothing like success. Our other explorations have been zero. I had never imagined it would be this big,\" Walsh told Reuters in an interview last month.\n",

            "The \"Great Leap East\" in Shanghai real estate has begun, with the property market in the Pudong zone beginning to look up, thanks to official pressure on foreign banks to move over there, property analysts said.\n",
            "But the overall outlook for Shanghai's office property market remains grim from the developer's point of view -- vacancy rates are around 30 percent and likely to rise to 60 percent by the end of 1997 due to a forest of new buildings, the analysts said.\n",
            "Pudong's Lujiazui district has been designated by the Chinese authorities as the future \"Wall Street of Asia\".\n",
            "But the office space glut and transport difficulties have kept people away, until now.\n",
            "\"The great leap east is in progress,\" said Sam Crispin, senior manager with real estate firm First Pacific Davies in Shanghai.\n",
            "\"There's been a rapid shift in interest with the banks moving over there. The service sector will then follow,\" he said.\n",
            "Leading the leap to Pudong are the foreign banks which have been bluntly told by the Shanghai city government that they will not be able to do local currency business unless they put their headquarters in Pudong.\n",
            "Eight foreign banks have been given approval to do local yuan business in the past month, and they are busy setting up their Pudong operations, while other foreign banks with full branches in Shanghai are lobbying hard to gain the same privilege.\n",
            "Crispin said Lujiazui's office vacancy rate was probably around 75 percent at present, and would probably remain at that figure for the rest of the year.\n",
            "\"I don't see any significant decline by the end of this year because there's significant amounts of stock coming onto the market,\" he said.\n",
            "James Hawkey, research manager for Jones Lang Wootton in Shanghai, said that while vacancy rates in Pudong were high, the take-up rate was accelerating.\n",
            "\"The vacancy rate (in Pudong) is currently 69.7 percent, but that's to be expected for a newly-developed area,\" he said.\n",
            "\"There's a lot of new supply in 1997, but vacancy rates will probably start to move down,\" he said.\n",
            "With supply far in excess of demand for the foreseeable future, the analysts said they saw Shanghai real estate prices overall sliding further.\n",
            "The foreign banks are paying $20-24 per square metre per month for prime Pudong office space, compared to rates double that or more on the other side of the river in central Shanghai, analysts said.\n",
            "\"Rates (in central Shanghai) are likely to slide over the next couple of years. They may come down to about $30, but what the market is seeing now is that companies that want quality space are willing to pay for it,\" said First Pacific Davies's Crispin.\n",
            "Another real estate broker said he saw the price floor for quality office space in Shanghai at somewhere close to $10-15 per square metre per month.\n",
            "\"The bottom of the pit is the limit, there's too many buildings,\" the broker said. \"But there's still a shortage of really good properties.\"\n",
            "A Chinese real estate broker said grade A real estate in Pudong was already renting for around $15 per square metre per month.\n",
            "\"The overall occupancy rate is about 30-40 percent, although some of the better buildings are over 50 percent. But it will be three to five years before Pudong property is really fully absorbed,\" the broker said.\n",

            "A new osteoporosis drug reduces the risk of broken hips by 51 percent among women who already have suffered fractures caused by the debilitating bone disease, researchers said on Tuesday.\n",
            "In research presented at a medical meeting, Dennis Black of the University of California at San Francisco said results were so promising that the first part of the study was ended early so all the participants could get the drug.\n",
            "Black said 2,027 women aged 55 to 80 who previously had suffered spinal fractures due to the disease were enrolled in the study, with half of them getting the drug alendronate and half getting a placebo.\n",
            "Women taking the drug were 51 percent less likely to suffer hip fractures over a three-year period and 55 percent less likely to suffer painful new spinal fractures.\n",
            "Researchers ended the first phase of the study in October because they felt it would be unethical to continue giving patients the placebo, Black told the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.\n",
            "The second part of the research, studying the effect of the drug on 4,400 post-menopausal women with osteoporosis who had not suffered previous spinal fractures, will be completed early next year, Black said.\n",
            "Alendronate, sold under the trade name Fosamax by Merck and Co., was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in October 1995 based on a smaller study that showed it increased bone mass density.\n",
            "As of July 30 the company had generated $100 million in sales from the drug, a company spokeswoman said.\n",
            "Merck has its eye on the even more lucrative market for prevention of osteoporosis, which affects an estimated 25 million Americans, the vast majority of them post-menopausal women who suffer bone loss when their bodies stop producing estrogen.\n",
            "Currently only estrogen-based drugs are approved for prevention of osteoporosis, but Merck filed an application with the FDA in April seeking similar approval for Fosamax, a non-hormonal drug.\n",
            "Researchers at the meeting were to present evidence on Wednesday that Fosamax stops bone loss and restores bone mass at the spine and hip.\n",
            "Black noted that hip fractures are among the most debilitating symptoms of osteoporosis, leading to permanent disability in 50 percent of the cases and costing the U.S. economy $5.4 billion annually.\n",
            "He said the research showed that \"even women with advanced osteoporosis can benefit from treatment.\"\n",

            "While Microsoft enters a field crowded with Internet startups, local niche players and established media powers, the software heavyweight, with its $10 billion cash hoard, brings nearly unmatched ability to sustain short-term losses, and few doubt its staying power.\n",
            "\"I think they will be a major presence,\" said Larry Gerbrandt, an analyst with Paul Kagan Associates. \"They have the size to jump-start businesses. The question is whether a national infrastructure can be more efficient than a whole bunch of local entrepreneurs.\"\n",
            "The field is crowded with both types of players, all aiming to get a slice of the highly fragmented $72 billion market in local advertising.\n",
            "Microsoft's strategy is to focus on listings for entertainment and leisure activities led by restaurants, movies and music.\n",
            "\"The core thing we identified in our research was the fact that consumers are working more and more and have less free time,\" said Gayle Troberman, consumer marketing manager for Sidewalk. \"So the choices they make become increasingly important.\"\n",
            "The Seattle Sidewalk site offers users the ability to personalize content based on preferences and activate \"agents\" that will remind them about specific performers and events.\n",
            "Articles written by an editorial staff of about 14 full-time journalists will highlight major events and trends, but the core of the site is a series of searchable databases of rated movies, restaurants, outdoor activities and events.\n",
            "Microsoft is aiming to capture part of the revenue that traditionally goes to local newspapers, and at least in Seattle the dominant newspaper has acted quickly to protect its turf.\n",
            "\"If we don't respond, somebody will eat our lunch,\" said Michael Fancher, executive editor of The Seattle Times.\n",

            "Fancher cited the newspaper's long-term commitment to providing regional news \"regardless of the financial model.\"\n",
            "\"I don't think that this is a natural fit for Microsoft, and I think once they've stimulated the competition they'll move on,\" Fancher said.\n",
            "Others are not so sure.\n",
            "Charles Conn, chief executive officer of two-year-old CitySearch, which already operates in 12 U.S. cities, said Microsoft is one of its few rivals to build a journalistic presence in each city rather than simply provide a \"hodgepodge of hypertext links.\"\n",
            "\"I'm glad to have another serious player in the business,\" Conn said. \"I think we're going to see sites like CitySearch and Sidewalk really break through the clutter.\"\n",
            "In contrast to Sidewalk's narrow entertainment focus, CitySearch provides a broad platform for community news and information, generally in partnership with a local news organisation.\n",
            "CitySearch's financial model is also much different, based largely on creating and operating Internet sites for thousands of small and medium-sized businesses, which pay $49 to $99 a month.\n",

            "Greenalls, owners of the 21-strong De Vere Hotels chain, 2,360 pubs and 470 off-licenses, earlier reported a 47.9 percent rise in pre-tax, pre-exceptional profits to 148.7 million in the year ended September 27. Greenalls has seen improved hotel occupancy and conference business as the corporate sector turned more buoyant and people took more leisure breaks in the year, said Daresbury.\n",

            "This strategy should give the company more exposure at the top end of its pub estate to improvements in consumer spending, said Daresbury.\n",

            "The Czech Republic appeared headed for its first budget deficit despite earlier reports by the fiscally-hawkish government that it had achieved a surplus for the fourth successive year.\n",
            "\"(We expect) the definitive results for 1996 will range around a deficit of 1.7 billion crowns,\" Deputy Finance Minister Miroslav Havel said on Wednesday in testimony to parliament's budget committtee.\n",
            "The Czechs have had three surplus budgets since Czechoslovakia split in 1993.\n",
            "Final data were due in the ministry on Wednesday but as local media paid close attention to whether monetarist Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus would maintain his fiscal winning streak, Havel said the trend was not positive.\n",
            "He said that by Wednesday revenues totalled 482.8 billion crowns, while expenditures were 484.5 billion.\n",
            "More bills may be delivered after the deadline, inflating expenditures further, Havel said.\n",
            "The government made last-ditch efforts in December when the budget looked headed for a more than five billion crown deficit, by freezing some outlays until 1997, and requiring early repayment on credit granted to a deposit insurance fund.\n",
            "The budget has been hampered by lower-than-expected tax revenue and delayed repayment on credits to Russia.\n",
            "The 1996 budget was originally approved as a balanced budget totalling 497.6 billion crowns, but an autumn round of spending cuts knocked the forecast expenditure down to 491 billion crowns.\n",
            "Parliamentary budget committee chairman Jozef Wagner, a member of the largest opposition party, the Social Democrats, said the 1996 deficit was not troublesome, but he was concerned with the effects government payment adjustments may have on the 1997 budget.\n",
            "Part of the December stop-gap measures included postponing payment of 800 million crowns in state subsidies for housing loans which was due to the partially-privatised banks Ceska Sporitelna a.s. and IPB a.s.\n",
            "Klaus, who calls balanced budgets the \"alpha and omega\" of his government, hailed initial reports of a 1996 budget surplus, made by the finance ministry soon after the new year, as a sign of the country's continued fiscal responsibility.\n",
            "Parliament approved a fifth straight balanced budget plan in December, with both expenditures and revenues forecast at 549.1 billion crowns in 1997.\n",
            "But the 1997 budget was based on economic growth of 5.4 percent, and many independent analysts have forecast growth for this year at under five percent, after growth between 4.0 and 4.5 percent for the whole of 1996.\n",
            "Many have voiced concern that slower than expected economic growth might force the government to consider major changes in the 1997 budget to keep a much larger deficit at bay.\n",

            "Initial market reaction was positive, Mirror shares adding seven to 208.5p by 0845 GMT.\n",
            "\"Mirror Group has outperformed other newspaper companies in absorbing a 35 percent increase in newsprint costs, maintaining high levels of marketing investment in the brands and still producing an increase in profits,\" chief executive David Montgomery said in a statement.\n",
            "\"The quality of these results confirms Mirror Group as an efficiently run media business now capable of further expansion by deploying its core skills,\" Montgomery added.\n",
            "Mirror Group's flagship title is the tabloid Daily Mirror, Britain's second-top selling newspaper. It also has a major stake in The Independent broadsheet and has recently branched out into cable television.\n",
            "The costs of newsprint -- the material on which newspapers are printed -- rose by 18 million pounds year-on-year but Mirror said it had largely managed to off-set this through higher advertising and circulation revenues.\n",
            "Finance Director John Allwood said that cover price rises had helped to boost circulation revenue by 11 million pounds while advertising revenue was up by around five million.\n",
            "With newsprint price now levelling off, Allwood said that the company would now seek to win new readers with special supplements to its core titles.\n",

            "With only 70 days left before Britain hands Hong Kong back to China, the Black Watch regiment headed to the hills of the New Territories to play jungle war games and ignore, for a few hours, the fast-approaching end of British rule.\n",
            "Shots ripped through the air and red flares spewed smoke as sweat-drenched soldiers laden with gear waded across rivers, charged up and down hills and crawled through lush and heavy undergrowth in a practice assault on an enemy camp.\n",
            "The Black Watch -- dubbed the \"Highland Furies\" by the French after the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745 -- are nearly half-way through an historic tour of duty in Hong Kong.\n",

            "\"I'll miss it. We'll miss it, because you don't get training like this on a regular basis on a tour,\" said Corporal John Lyon, 28. \"This area you can train throughout the whole time you're here.\"\n",
            "Lieutenant-Colonel Alasdair Loudon, commanding officer of the Black Watch in Hong Kong, said the New Territories have become something of a secret weapon.\n",
            "Few would guess that less than one-hour's drive from the concrete jungle of Hong Kong Island lie stretches of hot, humid and heavily overgrown countryside which represents a challenge for British troops.\n",
            "\"For us, it's harsh terrain. We're not used to the heat, we're not used to the hills and when you get away from tracks the undergrowth is very difficult. So it's demanding,\" he said.\n",
            "The Black Watch also had a busy day on Monday -- they were escorting an advance party of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers as they drove from the border to the Prince of Wales barracks in the territory's Central business district.\n",
            "The 40-strong PLA party are to lay the ground for up to 10,000 Chinese troops likely to be stationed in Hong Kong after the handover.\n",

            "Maytag Corp., boosted by its Hoover floor care line, said on Thursday its earnings for the fourth quarter more than doubled from a year ago as the company returned to profitability for the full year.\n",
            "Maytag said Hoover posted double-digit gains in sales for the quarter and the year.\n",
            "Looking ahead, however, Maytag said it saw a slow start for its earnings in 1997, as it shoulders marketing costs for several new products, including another Hoover upright floor cleaner, refrigerators and washing machines.\n",
            "\"Overall, we expect our earnings performance to start slowly but to pick up after mid-year, when much of the sales and earnings impact from these product introductions will begin to be realised,\" Chairman Leonard Hadley said in a statement.\n",
            "The company said its 1996 profits were helped by lower raw material costs and four months of results from its joint venture partner in China, Hefei Rongshida, which is one of that country's leading washing machine manufacturers.\n",
            "\"The joint venture with RSD in China, which we announced in September 1996, also contributed positively to the corporation's results, and we continue to be very enthusiastic about that business opportunity,\" Hadley said.\n",
            "For the fourth quarter, Newton, Iowa-based Maytag reported earnings of $35.3 million, or 36 cents a share. That compared with year-ago earnings of $16.6 million, or 16 cents a share, a year ago that included about $24 million in charges.\n",
            "\"It was a good quarter,\" said Natwest Securities analyst Susan Gallagher, adding that the results were in line with Wall Street expectations.\n",
            "For the year, Maytag posted a profit of $136.4 million, or $1.34 a share, after $41.5 million in restructuring and debt charges. In 1995, Maytag had a net loss of $20.5 million, or 19 cents a share, after taking $186.8 million in charges or one-time losses.\n",
            "Maytag's sales for the year of $3 billion were about equal with the 1995 level, which included $181.2 million from divested operations. Sales from ongoing operations, including new ventures, rose 5 percent in 1996, the company said.\n",
            "Major appliance sales for the fourth quarter increased from a year ago, Maytag said. But major appliance sales for the full year were flat with 1995, with the Maytag and Jenn-Air premium brands selling well, while value-priced brands were off somewhat. Maytag's brands also include Magic Chef and Admiral.\n",
            "Refrigeration sales in particular were weaker in 1996 due to competition and a sharp decline in private-label sales to national accounts.\n",
            "Sales of Maytag-brand commercial laundry equipment increased during the year, along with the company's share of the commercial laundry market.\n",
            "Maytag will launch several new products in 1996, including a new Hoover upright floor cleaner in the second half of the year. It will launch new top-mount refrigerators, with a freezer compartment on top, in February, followed by side-by-side models in late 1997 and early 1998.\n",
            "Maytag also will launch a new horizontal axis washing machine in March, starting with equipment for commercial laundries. Horizontal axis washing machines, a technology that is popular in Europe, do not use an agitator.\n",
            "\"A lot of trains are pulling into the station at once,\" Maytag spokesman Tom Schwartz said of the company's schedule of new product launches.\n",
            "Maytag said it expects its Dixie-Narco vending machine equipment business to improve its earnings in 1997. Dixie-Narco's operating results were break-even for the fourth quarter and operating profits declined 54 percent for the year to $10.7 million.\n",
            "Maytag's stock was unchanged at $20 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading.\n",

            "After months of talks, 36 separate legal agreements and six major research programmes, the two groups said that they planned to form two joint ventures to combine the BBC's archive, scheduling and production skills with Flextech's funds and multi-channel TV management and marketing knowledge.\n",
            "The principal deal will be to develop and launch  mainly digital new pay-television channels in Britain.\n",

            "Dubbed Horizons, Showcase, Style, One-TV, Arena, Learnings, Catch-up TV and Sports Entertainment Network, the eight planned channels include factual programmes, comedy and drama, leisure and lifestyle, the youthful spirit of Radio 1 on TV, music and arts, education, sports news and analysis and recently-transmitted programmes on BBC1 and BBC2.\n",
            "Under terms of its licence, the BBC has to show its programmes first for free to domestic British audiences who fund the corporation though television licence fees.\n",

            "Flextech and BBC Worldwide will take a 50 percent stake in the two ventures for up to 30 years. The service will be rolled out towards in late 1997.\n",

            "BBC Worldwide is developing channels for the U.S. and other markets with Discovery Inc, a sister firm to TINTA.\n",
            "\"Outside the UK, the BBC is probably the last, great, under-utilised English language library in the world,\" Singer said.\n",
            "BBC Worldwide is keen to stress that its move into commercial television will benefit both the company and its national audience -- that pays its licence fee -- by supplementing its licence income \"in a meaningful way\".\n",
            "And the deals leave Flextech, which will receive most of the cash flow until its debt is repaid, as a serious contender to British satellite broadcaster BSkyB as a key pay television programme provider.\n",
            "Flextech and the BBC confirmed that they would give the first option for the transmission of up to five of the digital channels to BkyB and its partners.\n",
            "BSkyB has linked up with Carlton Communications Plc and Granada Group Plc to form British Digital Broadcasting in a bid for licences to operate up to three, domestic, multi-channel digital frequencies.\n",
            "Flextech, which simultaneously reported flat annual pretax, pre-exceptional losses of 16.8 million pounds, is buying out pay-TV channels UK Gold and UK Living by issuing 34.95 million shares to owners media groups Pearson, America's Cox Communications Group and BBC Worldwide.\n",

            "Chrysler Corp. Tuesday announced $380 million in new investments for South America, including assembly plants for pickup trucks and diesel engines in Brazil and the expansion of a Jeep plant now being built in Argentina.\n",
            "Chrysler, which is cautiously trying to rebuild its international presence, said the projects in Brazil were worth about $315 million, and the expansion in Argentina was worth about $65 million.\n",
            "Roughly one third of the total investment, or about $126.6 million, will come from Chrysler's suppliers, who will play a major role in the automaker's low-risk global growth strategy, Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton said.\n",
            "\"We don't intend to make risky investments just to be a major player in emerging markets,\" added Thomas Gale, Chrysler's executive vice president of international operations. \"We're quite content to grow at a steady pace in regions where we see solid opportunities.\"\n",
            "Eaton said the investments will boost Chrysler's sales in the Mercosur free-trade zone, which groups Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.\n",
            "But the company's limited production capacity will allow it only to grab a small portion of the Mercosur market away from rivals General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG, he said.\n",
            "\"We are targeting very specific market segments,\" he said. \"We don't have any interest or desire to offer a vehicle for every possible application.\"\n",
            "The new Brazilian plant, which will be Chrysler's third limited-production facility in South America, will assemble the automaker's all-new Dakota compact pickup truck for sale in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, the countries in the Mercosur free-trade zone.\n",
            "In Argentina, Chrysler said it will add production of about 6,000 Jeep Cherokees a year at a plant now under construction in the Cordoba province. The plant is already scheduled to build about 14,000 Jeep Grand Cherokees per year starting next April, and Cherokee output will begin in 1998.\n",
            "A site for the Brazilian plant will be selected by year-end and vehicles will roll off the assembly line starting in mid-1998, Chrysler said. Production, however, will be modest, with 12,000 trucks in the first year and an ultimate capacity of 40,000 units annually. Employment will start at 400 people.\n",
            "The trucks at first will be largely assembled from \"complete knock-down\" kits shipped from the United States, but the automaker intends to meet the Mercosur trade bloc's 60 percent local content requirement after three years.\n",
            "Chrysler has not decided whether to market the Dakota under the Dodge brand name or under one of its other brands. The automaker now uses the only Jeep and Chrysler brand names outside the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n",
            "The $315 million Brazil investment also includes a new diesel engine plant to be built by Detroit Diesel Corp..\n",
            "The $10 million facility will supply the company's Italian-designed VM Motori four-cylinder turbocharged diesel engines for use in the Brazilian Dakota as well as in Jeep models built in Argentina. Chrysler installs about 40,000 of the engines annually into minivans and Jeep Grand Cherokees sold in Europe.\n",
            "Others suppliers supporting the Chrysler by opening plants in Latin America include Dana Corp., Johnson Controls Inc., Lear Corp., Lear Corp. United Technologies Corp. and PPG Industries Inc., Chrysler executives said.\n",
            "Eaton said total annual vehicle sales in the four-country Mercosur region will increase from about 2 million units currently to about 2.5 million by the end of the decade.\n",
            "\"We think this is a major growth area,\" Eaton said. \"It's politically and economically a stable region, we think with particularly rising consumer buying power.\"\n",
            "Including a small plant in Venezuela that assembles Cherokees and Neon small cars from kits, the investments announced Tuesday bring to $735 million the total financial commitments Chrysler and its suppliers have made in South America, the company said.\n",

            "The Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd (IBJ) is working on radical reforms of its corporate structure and staff policies to gear up for the approaching era of \"Big Bang\" deregulation, financial sources said on Wednesday.\n",
            "The bank will announce the plan, which is being spearheaded by president Masao Nishimura, in the coming months, they said.\n",
            "The move would be another sign of the drive among Japan's debt-burdened banking industry to boost efficiency ahead of the reforms, which aim to liberalise the financial markets by 2001.\n",
            "Nishimura held a luncheon meeting with analysts last week and sent a strong signal that the bank would soon clarify its strategy for success in a competitive, deregulated environment after Big Bang, they said.\n",
            "This could include performance-related pay and other mechanisms designed to reward expertise and initiative rather than seniority.\n",
            "An IBJ spokesman confirmed that president Nishimura had the meeting with economists and analysts, but did not give further details.\n",
            "IBJ is working on a programme which includes a change in its corporate structure and the introduction of pay based on individual merit, said the sources, who did not want to be identified.\n",
            "In Japan, tinkering with personnel practices is widely considered taboo, particularly at big banks, which are generously staffed compared with their international counterparts.\n",
            "IBJ is aiming to be an international investment bank offering a variety of products to corporate customers and also intends to use a financial holding company, they said.\n",
            "Nishimura told the Nihon Keizai Shimbun recently that the bank was considering boosting efficiency by setting up a company with a bank, securities house and trust banking firm under its umbrella.\n",
            "Japan is expected to lift a ban on establishing financial holding companies next year, they said.\n",
            "Analysts said that under a holding company, barriers between banks, brokers and insurers could be broken down and major banks could streamline their financial groups and bail out weaker affiliates.\n",
            "The sources said that a sense of crisis is needed at the management level of Japanese banks as the reforms aimed at deregulating Japanese financial markets by 2001 will expose banks to greater competition from both domestic and international rivals.\n",
            "If IBJ were to announce a radical reform programme, it would probably be welcomed by investors, they said.\n",
            "IBJ, the biggest of Japan's three long-term credit banks, provides long-term loans to big corporations by mainly obtaining funds through bank debenture issues, not deposits.\n",
            "However, the businesses of long-term credit banks have been hurt by recent moves by corporate clients to raise funds through the securities market.\n",
            "Worries about their business outlook have also increased as the proposed Big Bang deregulation will lift barriers between various financial sectors that have hitherto protected the banks' business territory, they said.\n",

            "Britain's Bass plc has added to its already substantial holdings in the Czech Republic by increasing its stake in brewer Pivovar Radegast a.s..\n",
            "Radegast Director Jan Sikora told Reuters on Tuesday that Bass had raised its stake in the company -- one of the \"Big Four\" Czech brewers -- by about 10 percent to 30.07 percent, but would not say from whom the stake had been purchased.\n",
            "The Czech news agency CTK, quoting unnamed sources, reported earlier that Bass had bought 9.97 percent of Radegast from Raiffeisen Capital and Investment Praha.\n",
            "But Raiffeisen and Bass officials would not confirm the report and Sikora would not disclose any further details.\n",
            "The Prague-based bank Investicni a Postovni Banka a.s. is Radegast's largest shareholder with a 34 percent stake while a fund managed by the investment arm of Czech insurer Ceska Pojistovna a.s. holds 30 percent.\n",
            "In July, Bass took an initial 20 percent stake in Radegast, augmenting Bass's Czech portfolio which includes a majority holding in Prague Breweries (Prazske Pivovary) and two smaller provincial beer makers.\n",
            "Since buying shares in 1993 in Prague Breweries, makers of the flagship lager Staropramen, Bass has aggressively marketed Czech beer abroad and especially in Britain.\n",
            "Radegast, which brews a popular lager with the same name and which was a major sponsor of the Czech national football team in the European championships last year, is based near the northeastern city of Ostrava.\n",
            "In the first nine months of 1996, it posted a gross profit of 281.5 million crowns ($10.35 million), up from 230 million for the same period in 1995. ($1=27.19 Czech Crown)\n",

            "A major reshuffle of executives at scandal-tainted Nomura Securities Co Ltd should help the brokerage transform its corporate culture and restore investors' trust, analysts and company sources said on Tuesday.\n",
            "\"I think the resignation of many executives will have a good impact on Nomura as it will make it easier for new management to reform its corporate culture,\" said Yushiro Ikuyo, first vice-president of Smith Barney International Inc.\n",
            "The drastic reshuffling was a surprise, and could be what is needed to help encourage small investors to return to Japan's stock markets, he added.\n",
            "Earlier on Tuesday, Nomura announced that president Masashi Suzuki will resign on May 1 and will be replaced by managing director Junichi Ujiie.\n",
            "Nomura also said that 15 company board members, including five vice presidents and four senior managing directors, will resign on April 30 and become company advisers.\n",
            "Suzuki, who will retain his chairmanship but lose his right to represent the company, told a news conference that the executives will not join in the decision-making process after they become advisers and are expected to leave Nomura to join companies affiliated with Nomura.\n",
